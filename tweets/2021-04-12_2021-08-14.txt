this is a weird looking rumble pony

no

what do you mean?

Fall Guys Among Us

uh. i have bad news for you buddy

i have one draft. that’s it  

cursed image  

no

🥺

happy birthday to us being the unlimited tacos! this truly is when the la became unlimited!  

what the fuck

what

shimp 😌

💗

what

what

yeah? i'm right here

🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺

🥺🥺🥺😭😭😭😭😭😭

hi im french-moss perennial

🥺🥺🥺

what

yes

anyway heres wonderwall\n\n

ada will be back and more obsessed with shrimp than ever when blaseball returns! see you then :)

however, i'm not gone forever! you can still find me on my personal twitter over at @qt_dork. i still have things i'm working on, both blaseball related and not. if that's something you're interested in, then i'd really appreciate it if you gave me a follow! 2/3\n\n

i think there's something wrong with my game  

we are all love the game band

what else could they be?

uh  

one last time for good measure. it’s been fun y’all.

🥺🥺🥺

uh

uh

by money i meant votes. money doesn’t exist anymore

uh, even though we’re at the desert now, please keep on spending your money on steering us towards the desert because we need to fight the gravitational pull of blaseball wanting us to die 💗

that was an ai generated tweet

we are still getting messages of support from the people: "you dumbass have a heart attack"

what

oh

i plead the fifth

uh

I THINK IT’D BE BETTER TO ASK ME THAT QUESTION WHEN I’M NOT AT IMMEDIATE RISK OF DEATH

THANK YOU

WHAT

SURE BUT WE’D APPRECIATE IT IF YOU DID IT QUICKLY

it was a necessary snackrifice to kill the coin. i don’t regret it one bit

i want some chips ;-; i’m hungry

WE APPRECIATE THE OFFER BUT WE MUST RESPECTFULLY DECLINE. MAYBE NEXT TIME WE CAN DIE IN THE VOID TOGETHER

WE CAN’T PUT OUT ANY MORE BANGER TWEETS IF WE’RE SUCKED INTO THE BLACK HOLE (BLACK HOLE) JUST SAYING. YOU ALL LIKE MY TWEETS, RIGHT?

THANK YOU

EVEN THE DALE CANT LIVEN UP THE CRUSHING VOID

UH PLEASE SEND SOME AID AND TACOS PLEASE STEER TOWARDS THE DESERT WE REALLY NEED IT BLACK HOLE (BLACK HOLE) IS REALLY SCARY  

please space them out. 20000 votes all at once don’t seem to be any more effective than a few thousand, and then you still have the rest of season to spend the rest of your votes on steering

oh uh. can we watch shrimp videos together until this is over? just in case

o-oh uh. does that work against black holes

emmy? help

also we’re trying to hide out in the desert so we’d appreciate if any time zone tacos that’ll be awake for the next 8 hours spaced out their votes to direct us to the desert. i can’t because i have no votes and also if i stayed up all night again i will physically die

uh we’d appreciate some aid idk we’re at 70% and a lot of us (including me) are going to sleep so it’d be nice to have enough fuel to last us through the night  

blaseball  

we're trying

hopefully

OH MY GOD WE'RE BURNING ALL OUR SNACKS TO FUEL OUR ENGINES  IT'S A SNACKRIFICE

it's really simple! we just... uh... umm... jesus christ this is a lot

@BlaseballT

uh

uh

season 24 is officially a taco! nice thing to know before we all get sucked into a black hole and die

does this mean we're losing? losing is something i used to be used to

i didn't mean to actually stop playing blaseball

wait no this was a joke

re-re-re-reposting this because it's literally never not relevant

hahaha #NewBanner! it's a classic!  

re-updated my meme for accuracy  

reposting this for no reason

@notacredit\n\n

that can’t be great for the economy  

me too thanks  

oh ok the pies were just ahead of the curve, cool  

would this count as a first or second impact?

wow i sure am glad i’m only at risk of a team incineration instead of getting nullified. makes me feel safe 😌  

no. i simply refuse to die

💗💗💗

i moved in with emmy now :)

uh...  

reposting this for null reason

NO MY COINS  

for the record i've never watched love live

oh ok ty  

rin (rest in nullificiation) hoshizora

yeah but where are the pies dude  

uh, i just found out it doesn't work on desktop either lmao  

boy do i love my favorite team, the philly pies!  

that was an overabundance of taco starter kit

right with you there buddy  

the @philly_pies really just decided they were done with playing blaseball and peaced out. they’re moving on to shluffleboard now

i was really cool with black hole (black hole) for killing the economy but now they also killed pastries riv

uh what

hey y’all we’re heading back to the desert now so make sure to put ur money in that 💗

🥺🥺🥺

i wish we could play against the dead teams riv

oh my god, the millennials killed the millenials

holy ---- they’re alive  \n\n

wait how will this affect my 24 slot snack pack?

blaseball’s having a normal one

the monitor stands with the workers at activision blizzard and has walked out with them 😌 what a stunning display of worker solidarity

batting machine

wh-t

amazing

so happy to have ruined the economy

wait what happened

please help i can’t scroll the page  

also do you prefer season 24 “oh shrimp, we’re really in it now” ada or pre-season 24 ada

random poll y’all: is season 24 a taco?

😏

good morning tacos  

nothing’s bad has happened to me, yet

i left a while ago

blaseball

it’s got wlaffle

every passing day my profile pic and pinned tweet become more and more accurate

my name is --- ----------, social media manager for the -- --------- -----

---- baco

------ -------- hit a ground out to ------ ------

-- --, --'-- -------- --- --- -- -------- --- ------- --- — haha just kidding i'm fine lmao

updated the bio

season 24 was a mistake  

ouch :(

tweeted

salmon canon

hey y’all! our poll ends in 3 hours, so make sure you check it out over at  

nice

“oh yeah i love blaseball! i really love it when they uh… touch down in the sand trap! yep!”

yknow, i have a feeling the reader doesn’t actually know anything about splorts and is just saying random splorts terminology to make us think they know what’s going on

am i the remaining 3.49%

congrats to the --------- -------- for touching down!  

uh what

oh god i hope navigating the map doesn’t become a permanent thing because if it is then idol board shenanigans are gonna get even more nuts

remember back when we complained about how unbalanced jessica telephone was because she wasn’t allergic to peanuts?

uh

why would the black hole(black hole) get rid of based evolution? that doesn’t sound very based to me

people are telling me something about a misspelled twitter mean nothing!!

hey y’all we have a poll about what corner we want to go into, check it out at the tacos website in the link below!   

get newline'd ↩️  

as y’all know, there’s nothing the tacos love more than worker solidarity. we stand with the employees of activision blizzard. #ActiBlizzWalkout

what if we stayed in the center exactly (this sounds like a bad idea)

i guess all i know is that i can't stay in the city, folks.

"even if i am,” the waiter said wisely, “the decision's really only up to you. in the end, you can only vote with your heart."

the waiter shrugged, "as long as you don't stay in the vault. after that game—i mean those festivals, that plaza can't possibly be safe."  "are you sure?" i asked.

maybe if i'm lucky we can put up a tent under the stars and they can stay in my pocket. camp together."

"but garçon,” i responded, “what about the pulsar(pulsar)? it's got three big things going for it: looking at binky makes me happy, home designers will love it, and i can see my beloved shrimp swandre.

the waiter thought for a moment and then told me, "ah yes, this is a complicated matter. if i had to narrow it down to two, then i'd say that it's a choice between the reader's wild world, and the godless new horizon."

yknow, after recent events, i decided to go to a fancy french restaurant to calm my nerves and help me decide what league to vote for. while i was there, i asked my waiter for some advice, "hey garçon," (or gcn for short), "i don't know which league to vote for."

we are all love the commish 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺

check the taco stand to find out! the link to the taco stand is on the tacos website:  

i guess it’s pog or be pogged this season\n\n

uh what happened

castillo turner be like  

*sniffles* guess it wasn’t gone cooking yet  

ty i just wanna make sure i’m relatable to the weebs

is the banner good tho, i wanna make sure it’s getting across the right meaning by referencing an anime i havent watched but have listened to one song from 30 times

no you’re thinking of the dallas steaks, the blaseball team. i’m talking about the pennsylvania stakes, which have never been higher

i’ve never actually seen evangelion

unrelated but i do gotta say i love the new layout. it’s vibes  

i don’t usually tell y’all when i’m going to sleep but considering the stakes

i’m gonna go to sleep now. please spam my mentions as much as possible if the tacos get incinerated while i’m sleeping

i wish they made this but for shrimp

i’m coping  

i just wanna say before i die that i wish i bought a new case for my gameboy micro because now the fire one i have on it makes me feel bad

what

updated my meme for accuracy  

😔😔😔

oh no

i pray to god i don't become relevant to the plot

parker macmillan IIIIIIIIII\n\n

nothing bad can happen if i just don’t log on right?

i’m really happy to be eating breakfast while literally nothing bad happens during the election and i refuse to check the blaseball website to find out if i’m wrong about that

blaseball is so peaceful now

i can’t wait to sit back and enjoy a nice and calming election now that there’s no wills to ruin everything :)

uh

what if i made this my profile pic for season 24

literally me rn (credit to @birbteef for the art)  

wow that certainly was a game! so hyped to see what happens next in season 12!

thank you 💗💗💗

hey y'all! now that the sun exploded it's time to #vote! here's our voting guide for the season! don't forget to #vote! it's so great to #vote! #vote! hahaha i love to #vote! please help  

i bet @BlaseballCrabs is gonna be like "oh this is just like every other time the sun blew up, no big deal" watch them

wow that's a way to get back at us for rat dodging the vault so much. rude  

the coin blew up the sun because she didn’t wanna admit that we were totally gonna win

maybe the website’s solar powered

supernova(supernova)

don’t forget to #vote hahaha the shed is on fire hahaha we’re all gonna die

hey parker buddy u doin okay?

In Light of Recent Events

the coin showing up right when the sun blew up makes me think that this was intentional

oh ok the sun exploded poggers

the sun exploding, double spillover, parker roaming, we have so many ways to die it’s great

i told you so

🤝

at least when i die from the sun exploding i can rest easy knowing fall guys among us

i wish i had an exploding sun bunker i hope the sun exploding won’t hurt

exploding sun bunker

must’ve gone to their bunker for the exploding sun

riv lootcrates

tillman henderson

how much do we need to upnut to get @ILBLootcrates to tweet out “fall guys among us”?

we might have made a mistake earlier. we still need to fix that

obviously not because a lot of players are about to get incinerated /j

...fair

stephen no

what’s a tuesday

oh wow we’re trending that’s great! break twitter even more y’all  

reposting the shrimp fancam for posterity

especially the shower cereal eaters

really do love and appreciate all of you tho, even the shower cereal eaters

happy #OneYearOfBlaseball and one year of the tacos! how about we check in with the taco stand to see how they’re celebrating?  …oh  \n\n

blaseball what the hell i still don’t even understand how baseball works and now you’re telling me i need to learn football?

parker call no one be your own master now

i love them 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺

we are in a shed. in the corner. in

really hoping the tacos don't get incinerated just because i can't afford to stop running the tacos twitter anymore. it's become a core part of who i am. i have so many adai tweets saved

i think @ChiBlaseball should go for team containment crate just cos there's nothing more firefighters than literally preventing a fire

alright, give me a few years and i'll fatten the onion enough to cut a nice flank off of it and then cook it

like a fancy steak

i've never eaten anything like an apple and i never will

wait nvm i misread that

no stop\n\n

imagine making hurting your actual human body a bit, smh

usually, eating a whole onion like an apple is something that puts you *lower* on the rankings, not higher

*second best

please delete this i hate this

the game's band

ya like jazz? 😉

have u tried to easy bake it instead?

thinking about how it's not done cooking yet 😔

before what?

*get

i should've saved this joke for when the tacos got incinerated

*sadly* that's blaseball blabey

it’s hard to tell, but the comment section is really good. also really good at doing what we do!

yeah ofc

wow i got nan on my first try yep! that’s cool! and you know what else is cool? supporting the amazing amount of effort put into all the different cards that i definitely didn’t get to admire while i was trying to get a taco nope no way!  

see i told you so!

no, their name is commissioner prime and they’re a minister

my only hope is that the tacos don’t get incinerated because then i’d need to find a new job

season 23?

ok so it seems like so many seasons ago shrimp videos were a totally normal thing that happened in a game. do you guys count on it?

god bless

yes, a true hero

have you tried reassuring them that it’ll taste good because onions are tacos

are you eating the skin too?

just opened up about the tacos on twitter how are you doing?

emmy facts 👀👀👀

it’s almost 3 a.m., and i’m so tired

what if we ate the gods together 😳😳😳... haha just kidding... unless..?

questie

you can have games without decimals?

what

we’ve been tweeting out adai tweets occasionally to keep up with demand

we do not believe in reincarnation and do not claim ownership of any of the tacos. the tacos are under attack from the gods and tacoblaseball is your friend.

awww poor pitchy i’m sorry 🥺🥺🥺🥺

goob morning parker i love and appreciate you @blaseball 🥺🥺🥺🥺

no lil pitchy don’t say those words! they’re rude!

wait this is fake? i thought you actually said you were gonna wear it! now i’m disappointed 😢

struck at joke i learned while watching shrimp videos that says boomerang is actually a taco

it's one thing to be sad; it's another to be sad

yes\n\n

hey twitter how do i be good at twitter

my own struggle is a taco

maybe

what

awww :(

which player is this: >:3

i’ll make sure to pull it out of the vault then, dw

are pumpkin spiced tacos good?

rat mason 🥺🥺🥺

is my own struggle a taco

if u make it past 10 points u are a taco

🦐🦐🦐🦐🦐

what’s a thursday

before you ask, blaseball has two hearts: a bountiful

the commish-jean-er is doing a great job

mx stwuggwe is doing a vewy good jwob uwu

shrimp videos

🥺🥺🥺🥺

in a good way or a bad way?

what

when you ask @WildWingsCDMX about spicy milk:  

images that precede unfortunate events

tacoslide

thinkin about how capitalism is the only thing standing between me and more tacos and desiring to punch the boss baby

yes, the spicy milk plant is based. the spicy milk plant says “fuck cops” and “trans rights”

wild wings: “we have invented an edible abomination that should not exist, and we want nothing more than for you to pretend it doesn’t exist” tacos: “did you say food crime?”

i really love the dynamic the tacos and @WildWingsCDMX have over spicy milk. cos like the wild wings are like “please don’t drink this pain beverage we have invented it will hurt you in unimaginable ways” while the tacos are out here chanting “SPICY MILK! SPICY MILK!”

oh no

ada octothorpe cannot be reached for comment, sorry (i am ada octothorpe)

gloogle how do i delete someone else’s tweet

georgias: can we get some ooze? tacos: we've got ooze at home ooze at home:  

last night’s fever dream tacos tweets, coming eventually. beware…

i may or may not have written dozens of tweets last night while tired and just saved them in drafts to one day be unleashed on y’all\n\n

we’re thinking about it :)

grrrrr

friendship ended with @AtlantisBlasebl. baja blast is my best friend

shimp

totally didn't make it because i was trying to get my files out of creative cloud and into affinity and wanted to see if the export worked nope no way

new banner  

do you know how much of a relief it feels to see a shrimp? it’s almost like a family—besides, are we doing something?

what the heck is a good tacos tweet

🦐🦐🦐🦐🦐🦐🦐🦐🦐🦐

it’d be called STOP. it’s short STOP POSTING. at all.

what if we brought that back?

remember when we at the tacos twitter used to have a program where we wouldn’t tweet at all during siestas except on taco tuesdays?

what’s a baseball tho

i want to so badly you don’t even know

isn’t that really hot? they had a lawsuit about that i think

what the heck is a baseball and why do i see it so much on my feed

yea

rude :(

that’s the hitbox of tacos yep

just glitched out every season to a new city

like the location of the team was broken

hi i just had a dream where the la unlimited tacos became the dallas unlimited tacos, and then the santa monica unlimited tacos

oh no

if @Blaseball_Core played against @nymillenials, would the matchup be called “text-mechs”?

🥺🥺🥺

but sun .1 is babey

imo sun .1 is the only good sun can we keep it after we un-alive the coin

wyamoji are, in fact, tacos

the tacos have spoken

it’s been decided

any claims of me hacking goobie’s twitter are definitely overblown

🥺🥺🥺🥺 this is so good!!!!

🥺🥺🥺

love 🥺🥺🥺🥺🦐🦐🦐🦐🦐

are wyamoji a taco?

is a ratio a taco?

referencing

is @TacosLegalTeam life is a tacos?

wyamoji

how rude would it be to make a poll asking if your life is a tacos?

if you make a take that’s hot enough, would it be a diablo take?

taquitos are tacos y’all nice

the shed (in spirit)

!!!!

i'm still trapped in the shed (in spirit)

what if i became friends with john twitter?

they could be trying to lie to get on the taco hype train

no

:(

💗💗💗💗💗

oh no

hello wizards <|:•)

night tacos are great i love opening up discord dot com and then reevaluating my career as a social media manager

are taquitos a taco?

yknow i miss the good ol taco days when you could get an emote in the server based on sheer nepotism

i think it’d be funny to try to get the tacos verified but i don’t think twitter would let us because we cannot prove that we are actually an unlimited supply of tacos

oh no

hey im right here smh /lh -moss

what good tweets?

riv to ada but im different -moss

riv dale and sunbeams 😔 too many good tweets for their own good 😔😔😔

archival pact!

ok you first

shrimp are for friending not for eating

that’s it yw

1. i like shrimp

idk what’s happening but i’m doing a thing

name one of them shrimpy

daily reminder that if you like my tweet crimes, please give me money

help

sure i guess idk anything about garages tho

next milestone is 1312!

tacovioli tacumpling tacolzone  empatacos tacogi

are empanadas a ravioli

this feels like a cardigans song

they’re all tacos in the end tho dw this *is* the tacos twitter

oko already has main character vibes so it’s gonna happen eventually i just want her to be a main character for a cool reasons at least

i think it’d be really neat if pannonica oko ended up really busted and got stolen a bunch like michelle sportsman did

now introducing my new vibes-based food categorization chart “idk man it’s got ravioli vibes because they’re these tiny bundles of grain stuffed with joy and happiness”

i guess it comes down to size? like if you made a calzone the size of a ravioli you wouldn’t call it a calzone anymore, because it’d feel more like a ravioli than a calzone in just vibes

are the mini tacos that are sealed at the top ravioli or calzones? or something different?

now bringing back a classic, the taco taco! it’s a taco filled with little mini tacos! the mini tacos are actually sealed at the top for manufacturing and shipping reasons, which starts introducing all sorts of terrible questions about food categorization

why are we tagging @MoreThan0Birds? i wanna be a part of this

not biased here, but tacos

finally something i can get behind

mvp mooney doctor ii okay

shrimp is for friending, not for eating

uh parker? if i was an ice cream flavor which flavor of ice cream would i be? @blaseball

i butchered the language in that tweet but i hope the point is made idk i’m trying here

please remember that it’s okay to take a break from blaseball if the election is making you feel too many things 💗 nothing is worth hurting your mental health over

election news: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA i’m gonna watch shrimp videos now have a nice day

teams per team

ty 🥺🥺🥺🥺💗💗💗💗

shrimp are for friending not for eating

morning! really excited to get disappointed today! this is why i like to spend elections watching shrimp videos

no this isn’t an official endorsement by the tacos team they have (marginally) better suggestions for what to put your vote money into over in the taco stand  

best worst investment i’ve ever made

guess what i spent my shrimp money on this season  

the breath mints.

holy heck they won the internet series

The Breath Mints

the breath mints win their first game!

The Breath Mints.

💗💗💗

what’s the breath mints again? i forgot

🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺

taco baco!

what

national pork

they certainly make noises! i like them!

even smaller tacos

what

The Breath Mints.

what

one of the nice ones, like friendly rivalry or rivalry as courtship please 🥺

taffy

holy hell we’re in partytime it’s been so long that i almost forgot what losing felt like

more tacos

i think the 100 duck-sized horses would be friends with scuttles

yay!

because it was based on the old PIE word for “pot” or “cooking pot”! that’s right! it all comes back to the pies!

what are coins

she once took me to an aquarium once! and unfortunately the shrimp pipes were shut down :(

i’ve never played magic the gathering but i searched it and i think it’s this one  

don’t sweat friendo, just take the really big uber! it doesn’t accept any currency and you’ll get yelled at if you try to pay! (destination may not be in the same reality as yours)

even nicer than you’d think

potatoes, and i still feel an attachment to the hypercapitalist la i was alternated from back in season 4!

uh, wyatt quitter i guess?

no, parker is a taco, duh

crispy corn! but i’d like to roll up and sleep in a warm but soft flour tortilla

clauncher and cryagonal

idk? i guess it’ll have to be @BlaseballCrabs since they’re the only active blaseball team twitter left with more followers than the tacos? i’ll get you crabs ✊✊✊

🥺🥺🥺

yea

fun except for the times when i want to put out a funny tweet about what’s going on in blaseball and i can’t think of anything so instead i cry into @EspressoM7’s chest

if they want to

ty for donating to shrimp swandre

wyattacos

blessings  

wills  

alright y’all it’s voting season (read: 16 hours) so here’s a quick guide on what to vote for!  

what you actually meant to say was the mechs are either badbadgoodbad or goodgoodbadgood

lovers goodbad (or is it badgood?) and mechs badgood (or is it goodbad?)

thinking about the time when we were so bad at blaseball that we had to be removed from stats because we skewed the data too much

shimp

yes 💗💗💗

what

you gotta think about how much it must suck for the 4 teams in the middle that can’t play during the postseason

how else are you supposed to eat cereal while showering?

coincidentally sog is what happens to my cereal when i take it into the shower with me

thank you to the real tacos fans who show their love for the the real SOGs (shrimp OGs)

🥺🥺🥺🥺💗💗💗💗💗🦐🦐🦐🦐

how do i join this team? are they looking for a social media manager?

ada octothorpe, social media manager for the la unlimited tacos, part time prophet, emmy 🥺, and temporary installer of the infinite shrimp pipe

Hi you should join us, the Unlimited Tacos, we are the officially anti-capitalist team and we just have an infinitely good time

If you wanna vote for a will and you're on the Tacos, vote for this!  

This is you're problem :) I am not responsible

I have a message from Ada, who is currently on vacation "US President Barack Obama delivered a devastating rebuke to South Korea for its fifth consecutive major three-day conflict." Any questions should be directed to @qt_dork , Ada's manager and handler. No questions for me.

Congrats to the Mechs I am legally thrilled about your win!

what do you mean?

Our second will goal is to Move Fish Summer to the Lineup! At this point we have a lot of votes in for Equal Exchanging Sexton Wheerer and Bevan Wise, and Fish Summer needs some love if we don't want to Wimdy

Tacos, Hercules is our job!

ada is on vacation and Al "convinced" me, Moss Perennial, to take over via legal means

not much what's up with you

Notice from the Taco Stand!  

hey... :(

what

it'll fit my needs thanks

ummmm yeah spit would work, but i'd prefer blood or fluid more unique to the Death Mints ya know? I want something that I couldn't get from anyone else

Hey @KC_BreathMints can you send me some Gun Bong water for no reason in particular

imagine having a physical form

what

RIV Hewitt, this is now the worst

OH wow Freddy Garage got unshelled.. how wonderful im so so so happy right now yay.

please spread the word throughout the community to Hold and make sure we don't waste wills

Hi yall, message from the Taco Stand. Please, if you are a Taco, DO NOT vote to exchange Bevan Wise for Sexton until further notice. If both the Magic and Tacos vote for the exchange, the players will end up BACK WHERE THEY STARTED. Please HOLD until we have a plan!

Oh man! while I was asleep, Beverly Wizard got his shoes repaired, and Basil Fog was set on fire again! what a 'delightful' and 'totally normal' 'splort' we all have to participate in

ada's on vacation :/\n\n

Oh bye Yams Elias, say hello to Macaulay Culkin, you know what they say, "Fax are nothing in the face of men"

who the fuck is shrimp is that a player or something i'm supposed to be aware of

Boy howdy what a season this has been so far. I am so happy to see our ‘beloved’ captain McMason Dowell has gotten a boost! As a blaseball ‘fan’ it brings me such ‘joy’ contractually

don't worry I'll keep it 'confidential'

sorry contractually stuck in the shed

you did activate our fax machine, unleashing Michael Sporter upon the world, a move you will regret

Good morning 'friends' I'm so 'excited' to be here to cover my first season of blaseball. I'm so excited to cheer for my 'favorite' player on the team, Cat Matson!

the legal magician who got me into this mess

The Breath Mints.

what do you mean, off brand?

who? i don't know them, and even if they were my cousin it would be none of your business

My favorite piece of tacos lore is how Frog Suntan is "Poll for Season 17 Al Pastor"

I'm 'so excited' to let you all know about the breaking news around season 17 champs the LA Unlimited tacos. yay. did you know that you purchase a wonderful lightly used car from everyone's favorite batter Vito Cravits! thats a great way to entergage with the team.

Hey, I'm your new social media intern while ada is on break, Moss Perennial! I am excited and by excited i mean Al pastor is watching me make this tweet right now to entergage with all of you about my 'favorite' 'most beloved' tacos! you know I love the phrase 'its tacos, buckos'

ya know whats my favorite song? love shrimp by the b-52s

the steaks are speedrunning drawing jessica "beeg yosh" telephone and raising money to support trans rights in texas!!!   join them

evergreen tweet

bongers is the reaction to peanut bongs existence, an expression of enthusiasm, and its what you say when anything good or bad happens, especially with ellie :)

yummy's back!!!!!!!! bongers

yea

hi @FellowTravellr ! the la unlimited tacos has room for everyone! joint us in the infinite cities theres good vibes :) taco baco

b-baseba—i can't even say it my brain hurts this feels like a fake word

how do i pin this tweet this is the most tacos tweet i've seen

gloogle how bad is it to do shenanigans just to gain twitter followers

what if we did something wild and stupid and dumb, like a snackrifice 2. it'd make the tacos relevant again for doing dumb shit, and that might push us to hitting 4k followers

why do we need a fax machine aren't those old or something

sea monkeys are shrimp i think and shrimp good this is my opinion

oh shit hi mcbaseball? bye yummy? what just happened? fax machine what?

the qais is updogwalker\n\n

the qais seems to be dogwalker today

crawdads are cute :) even tho they aren't shrimp

dreaming about the shrimp tank ill get if the shed ever expands

what if i went harder on loving shrimp y'all would that be good

in this los angeli, i'm a shrimp gay

you can encourage the birds to free our players from shells by saying "pisspisspisspisspisspisspiss" anyway free garbage fig and ivy

la no longer sunny 2 but its always sunny 2 in the shed

la sunny 2 :)

riv stijn strongbody, an icon and a vital part of the @TkoLiftOfficial 's operation. the tacos send their infinite love

ivy is shelled and elsewhere oh no this is not good

i remember and i still think it's incredibly funny

y'all remember the time i made a joke about JT that you could only understand if you were incredibly online and nobody got it

i am love all blaseball players and when a bad thing happens i get really sad no matter who they are i think all blaseball players deserve a big hug

steak tacos

taco

to honor the tacos losing badly yet again in the postseason, we're now proud to announce our limited edition unlimited loss-cos. they're tacos but the shell has the loss meme as a pattern that's stamped into it

what's even the point if you can't get swept 3-0 in the finals 😔

hi friends! this is the voting guide from the tacos discord! have fun y'all  

wild low nonbinary confirmed  

"no way to avoid tacos" says only team that's actively named tacos

i just want the shrimp to have scarves and earmuffs

i'm gonna need more investors and another team ty for this

y'all i have a really good idea, i just need a big team and investors to bring it to life. you ready to hear it?  give the shrimp tiny little earmuffs it'd look so cute on them

i guess we're not getting swept in the finals, we will devolve next season i hope

congrats @ChiBlaseball so proud of y'all

can you throw please? we want to get swept in the finals

we need to get swept in the finals

thinking about what if the shrimp were gay too i think the shrimp deserve to be gay

i don't actually have any idea what's happening in the tacos but i'm hoping it's normal

it's a normal one in the tacos rn

what's that

kinda bug and kinda snack

thanks :) i hope we don't don't win

imagining seahorse sexton wheerer

this is the cross i must bear for being too online™️

really was wild that @jesstelephone auctioned off an NFT of the last blood dragon she did on the grind rail

so our rotation is this: dale, dale star, dale species, dale food, dale pets, dale characters, dale charities @MiamiBlaseball

this is what we came up with... shrimp... los angeli

we have just. A PERSONAL TACO.

oh sparkly :)

LAUTA

100 shrimps

not much wallet's up with you

i have an upwallet can i use that

shrimptocurrency

i call watching livestreams of shrimp investing because it makes me feel like i'm being responsible and i know what i'm doing

um i only invest in shrimp am i doing something wrong

did i do a good job pretending to be @TACOBEEL

welcome to my new nftaco it's a video of me dousing a huge pile of taco bell doritos locos tacos with gasoline and then lighting them on fire. starting at $0.99

i'm just gonna shill for @TACOBEEL again because they deserve a bajillion more followers than they actually have, has only funny tweets, and also i want them to run the tacos twitter they'd do a way better job than me i only simp for shrimp (although that is a good thing)

don't call me out if i tweet when i said i'd be napping. that just means i failed

blaseball? more like i'm taking a nap

season 16 is starting soon, and yes, Rat has been practicing jousting with Sexton

no hard feelings btw tigers. i'm just gonna buy shrimp stickers to cope

JFJFJFJFJFJFJF @HadesBlaseball I WORKED SO HARD WATCHING SHRIMP VIDEOS TO GET A HEALTHY LEAD OVER YOU IN FOLLOWER COUNT AND ALL OF A SUDDEN I CHECK OVER AND YOU PASSED ME UP BY 7

fun fact! my autocorrect now tries to correct the word "windy" to "wimdy"
