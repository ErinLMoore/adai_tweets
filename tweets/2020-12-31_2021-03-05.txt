 tacos are now at 4.4k tacos tweets that’s really good for updating adai &gt;:3
 hi i’m crying and this time it’s not over shrimp
 we trust sexton (tacoganda by @dxscxple, assets from various sources)  https://t.co/VLQUZiWHyg
 tacos lose :)
 @IrisScreams me
 @BfWinkler no it’s losing time baybee
 @BfWinkler pfft
 don’t forget to tag @tacoblaseball in all of your tacos #blaseball fan art! please! people will leave if they see no art and only shrimp tweets
 this was a scheduled tweet
 NOW THAT IT’S DAY 99 IM SUPER PROUD TO SAY THAT SINCE THE TACOS ARE GOOD NOW, WE TOTALLY MADE IT INTO THE PLAYOFFS
 i have no idea what this means
 secret leak of tacos plans (credit to feather from the tacos discord)  https://t.co/3rf5NNA5hb
 tacos bad (but like in a good way) 💗💗💗
 @Nisrimar yes
 @patelbeyonce 😔
 are there shrimp themed taco places in the los angeli? (honestly, no)
 the tacos are losing like hell every single game!
 💗💗💗 @OhioWorms (credit to thethereminguy from the tacos discord)  https://t.co/6wMNdhEscM
 so i know where all the other teams are from, i mean they’re pretty obvious, but where in the world is ohio? i’ve never heard of that place before
 there’s a certain flavor to seeing the tacos get shamed
 let’s all be friends to the new teams btw, they all deserve some friends 💗💗💗
 is this what happens when you simp too hard? is blaseball punishing us for our simps?
 @CHSSTFans so it’s, like, a french word or something?
 who the heck is the baltimore crabs? is that a new team?
 @CHURGALAX i retweeted this not because i wanted to, but only because as a rule i retweet all tacos art i see
 @ttttheresaale i hope it's not shameful to root for losses or else i've been shameful since season 3
 oh no (credit to donnfirinne from the tacos discord server)  https://t.co/tiHXFAkOgY
 @siobhansabino you make it sound like you *don’t* have have a financial incentive to root for the tacos
 i wonder how much of @BlaseballT’s content is made up of the tacos? we could make it a data crime: tacos per struggle tweet, or we could see how many tacos tweets make it onto @BlaseballT: struggle tweets per struggle tweet (all tacos tweets are struggle tweets)
 @ChiBlaseball i would not let that taco into the human body i only have one of
 @idoldestroyer @MiamiBlaseball drafts are stored locally and aren’t synced to accounts :(

 @VincentPerea awww, we’re here for you!!!
 @BfWinkler sure
 @BfWinkler gotta lose fast
 @MiamiBlaseball ok! just bring it to the shed please!
 @RabidRonnie @Date_With_Beard @TkoLiftOfficial 💗💗💗💗
 @MiamiBlaseball oh can we have the one next to it?
 @ashinycoin what is there to not be excited about with shrimp?! shrimp are very good and we love them lots!
 @RabidRonnie @Date_With_Beard @TkoLiftOfficial wait isn’t that the tacos too?
 @RabidRonnie @TkoLiftOfficial you will be missed, but thankfully we’re good friends with @TkoLiftOfficial, so we’re still sorta friends!
 @MiamiBlaseball can we pick the one you’re using?
 @MiamiBlaseball can we borrow your speedboat as we speed into partytime?
 @TkoLiftOfficial oh ok
 i wonder how freaked out the daily shrimp twitter is because all of the likes and retweets are coming from some random twitter account about tacos
 (credit to DonnFirinne#0285 from the tacos discord)  https://t.co/AZdsadoedy
 good morning taco nation what did i miss
 @tediousdullard @MiamiBlaseball are you saying our social media strategy sucks? 😛
 @DetectiveKnack tacos win
  https://t.co/i1ZSCO0wVL
 @LupineAlpha not enough space :(
 @LupineAlpha shrimp plushie 🥺 makes me feel like i actually have an aquarium
 i don't keep track of anyone we're playing against because i'm too busy watching shrimp videos... sorry ;-;  i think we're playing against the sunbeams so i'm gonna suggest you buy that cool blanket @BlaseballCares made because it's very cute
 @Ickapotamus @BLASEBALLPEPITO @BLASEBALLPEPITO is a gift and may we never lose her 💗💗💗
 this probably doesn't work as well now that the tacos are absolutely stomping the dale sorry
 @NyabinaryNepeta favorite taco is the veggie delight subway sandwich (im not allowed to leave my shed and only subway will bring me food), my favorite addings are every single veggie option they have there EXCEPT olives.
 oh @MiamiBlaseball here i'm @-ing you idk how to use twitter
 now that we're fighting the dale in the bloodsport known as blaseball i'm reposting the nice gift i made for them. i hope they like it!
 i guess we hit 3.5k again so we're going to do an ama or something! idk just chat with us!
 OMG THIS IS THE BEST DAY OF MY LIFE 🦐🦐🦐🦐
 this tweet will be pinned and shilled for every now and again, i hope that’s okay with y’all 🥺🥺🥺
 wait what’s happening did i pick a bad time to beg
 okay, while we’re waiting, i want to chip in with a big announcement!  i opened a ko-fi! i’m not expecting much out of it, but every donation helps to make blaseball more sustainable, and to keep the tacos twitter taco-ing!   https://t.co/fi7oNPgcst
 what if... blaseball
 @HotdogWaterDunn @MiamiBlaseball i still don’t know who the miami dale are but thank you 💗
 i love every single one of you tacos 💗💗💗
 day two(sday) of blaseball and i’m already 10 followers away from 3.5k... getting back everything i lost in a matter of days
 @WildWingsCDMX NO STOP LETTING US WIN
 @MiamiBlaseball who’s the miami dale again?
 @MiamiBlaseball HECK
 good morning tacos! did we lose?
 tacos win :(
 wooooo ooo go tacos hit the ball nyooom
 @AdvntureAcademy you should've told me that before i bet on the tacos, now i'm gonna lose money
  https://t.co/Ac4VfDGs9Q
 the discord is taking it well  https://t.co/nvzchsmYY7
 NO STOP WINNING
 tacos lost &gt;:3
 TACOS LOSE
 oh shoot we won... sorry @TkoLiftOfficial
 @TkoLiftOfficial you misspelled @tacoblaseball
  https://t.co/HLgrZn51TE It's live if you want to join it!
 @TkoLiftOfficial yes 💗💗💗
 don't forget y'all that @CitiesPod is going live in about 30 minutes! check them out at  https://t.co/HLgrZn51TE!!!  https://t.co/PKpYvmM7pO
 @birbteef @blaseball love it!!! look at them go!!!
 our hearts are with the lost and marginalized in this nightmare world
 we don’t want anyone to think this way, but... let’s face it... tacos know how to eat people 😉
 we're 28 followers away from hitting 3.5k followers for the second time!
 just as a polite reminder, blaseball is a horror game, and bad things are probably going to happen, and we’re going to have to accept that. nothing incredibly bad has happened yet, but with blaseball it’s not a question of if, but when it’ll happen
 @BlaseballPro this can’t possibly end poorly
 today @ChorbyShort chose chaos and this is very tacos (can you join the tacos little frog?)
 oh shoot how do you make youtube links embed in twitter in the timeline why does twitter refuse to work
 THIS OLD VIDEO IS RELEVANT AGAIN FINALLY! TACOS BAD!   https://t.co/udnKL48jTx
 @MrPatrickDugan the way god intended :)
 @WildWingsCDMX riv cudi’s stlats 😔 condolences to @TkoLiftOfficial
 @WildWingsCDMX what happened?
 @catacalypto is this something i should interact with? use brand twitter power to make even your breakfast lunch become blaseball?
 @WildWingsCDMX tacos lose!!!
 @Rattleboneses awww... we miss you too!!! 💗💗💗
 @micpp42 tacos lose and that's good
 shrimp good btw
 wow i had to filter my notifications to mentions so fast tacos are just too big
 @Rattleboneses i've been here all siesta making bad tweets. what is there to miss?
 time for more #tacoganda!!! (credit to @DeeJayRingis)  https://t.co/BwsWYMhdgc
 @MonteCrisply server issues
 i think blaseball is breaking again
 what the heck it’s been one minute and the tweet already blew up
 losing is a viable strategy
 @MonteCrisply hello monte (acab)
 @Dared00 at least once is more than zero!!!
 there will be no indicator that lets you know a bot tweet was written by a bot
 now that blaseball is back we’d like to remind everyone that we at the tacos will sometimes tweet out tweets written by adai, the worlds first ai version of me, ada octothorpe. you’re welcome to guess in the comments who wrote any tweet that we send out, ada or the bot :)
 also then people would see me screen and they’d find out that i mostly watch shrimp videos and am really bad at my job of paying attention to blaseball
 i’d start a stream but the shed computer isn’t powerful enough and i’m not interesting enough to stream the ada octothorpe chatting channel
 how would i go about doing that?
 what if i, ada octothorpe, social media manager for the unlimited tacos, joined a stream about blaseball stuff
 @BlaseballT @BfWinkler i agree except the new is tacos. it’s saying you should eat tacos. and join the tacos. my reading is incredibly unbiased
 don’t forget that if you ever make any #tacoganda, please tag it with that and @ us, the unlimited tacos in it!
 time to post some #tacoganda because i have no idea what’s going on and funny pictures are a good substitute for learning! (credit to @DeeJayRingis)  https://t.co/xvDyIUCMCI
 hi i slept in what’d i miss
 @WildWingsCDMX @blaseballwatson we have a fifth blase?
 IT'S BEEN *HOW LONG* SINCE I STARTED THIS JOB?
 now that there’s more stuff to buy i can make number go up more!
 i’m only a little bit hyped if you can’t tell
 LA UNLIMITED TACOS!!!!!!
 @LupineAlpha simp for me please (yes)
 LA UNLIMITED TACOT

 tacos at the start of season 12 @TedLasso (credit to @DeeJayRingis)  https://t.co/p4e8vFTaH5
 @MiamiBlaseball raúl leal fluffy. would cuddle
 @C4NDL3W4X @xvipsixteen what that’s just me saying i don’t do drafts. i’m tired
 @C4NDL3W4X @xvipsixteen all my drafts become tweets. all of them
 what’s a blaseball
 @spacekid1999 @AReblase happy birthday abel!
 @BiffIfh no losing is a good thing why are you making it seem like a bad thing
 @hifridays hi!
 people keep on tweeting about me without @-ing me and then i miss all the tweets please just @ me
 @Daikaiju_Erin oh ok thank you
 @Daikaiju_Erin 💗💗💗💗💗💗💗
 the lift are vibes, go follow them (i’m just copying @hifridays)
 🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️ tacos say trans rights
 ada octothorpe (is gonna watch some shrimp videos)
 ada octothorpe, the commissioner of tacos
 the worst part of blaseball coming back is that i can’t make jokes about losing 10 followers a week anymore
 @TkoLiftOfficial i love you too 🦐
 but why shouldn’t i eat a battery?
 @VelaSauce @SunbeamsBickle no i don’t what do i know
 @TkoLiftOfficial @CHSSTFans shoe.............
 oh is blaseball back?
 @VelaSauce @SunbeamsBickle what. i’m confused
 @EspressoM7 okay
 taco is baco
 it me 🦐🦐🦐
 gloogle am i gay if i simp for emmy
 @philly_pies no
 @PinataPsychic oh wow. pretty wild that they only made one video game, but sometimes it be like that
 what's a video game
 are batteries a taco?
 @AReblase this is objectively good
 tacos
 we dont know anyone else who can come up with funny tweets without them being retweeted by a super cool
 this is anticapitalist so we at the tacos will try harder
 @NYMSplortscast ada octothorpe is so many vowels 💗
 t a c o s b a y b e e
 where’s the pokémon that starts out as a fox cat dog and then evolves into a crab
 IOAUUIOAUUIEHUAOEHUAOEOIH
 what do mean y’all i’m super duper fine there’s no problems with ada octothorpe social media manager for the unlimited tacos here
 @TkoLiftOfficial we’re best friends
 @TkoLiftOfficial no
 the best part of this is that i’m friends with everyone who responds to my tweets, but i still act like people outside of them read them and be all brand manager-y
 @AReblase @BlaseballT taco baco!!!
 there seems to be a 0.0001% chance that all of these tweets will be taken seriously...
 you're a shrimp now 💗
 @TACOBEEL because you’re a blessing 💗💗💗
 @betaraycarrie @blaseball_jazz WOAH THAT ART
 is taco baco a taco?
 is the hotdaco a taco?
 thank goodness you’ve come to terms with how bad capitalism is, and i’m not gonna lie, it wasn't hard at first. it’s ok. glad you came.
 taco baco
 ada octothorpe, social media manager of the shed down the street from a subway, no not that subway, THAT subway, yeah that one over there
 it's not special for y'all but it's special for me
 do have something special planned tho :)
 oh i forgot twitter existed, sorry
 tacos are babey heck yeah we win
 I think anyone can eventually tell the difference between a normal tweet and a fake one?
 it’s taco tuesday 👉👈
 @WildWingsCDMX isn’t cell barajas on like the lift or something?
 y'all should be scared of the crabs!! just kidding they don't exist now
 @etherknot shrimp
 @LupineAlpha i refuse to look it up out of fear
 ok we’re sorry for blowing up y’all’s feeds we’re taking a break from tweets until taco tuesday love y’all 💗
 shrimp pepitwo
 we’re now at having lost 60 followers since siesta are you proud of us
 “the tacos” twitter is chaotic and should be shut down.
 this is a new low AND it IS A TACO
 don’t forget that there are also unlimited tacos places in los angeli. tacosplores.
 while we strive to be the tacos best, we also LOVE to struggle
 @deerstained 🦐🦐🦐
 the tacos are a family. we can do this
 @EspressoM7 what
 @deerstained i can’t
 we’re just looking for some candid shrimp conversations!
 does anyone wanna chat with us about shrimp
 this account has shared custody between me, ada octothorpe, and adai
 is the unlimited tacos twitter basically a twitter bot? yes but sometimes i, ada octothorpe, social media manager for the unlimited tacos write new tweets too
 gloogle how do we shame the blaseball gods..
 myatt wason
 all of our tweets are text based because they can easily get fed back into adai and totally not because i’m too lazy to open up photoshop and have no ideas for image memes
 we just realized none of our memes are pictures how are we doing so well with just text based memes
 @BlaseballPolls you cannot rival the unlimited tacos in any way that matters
 @PinataPsychic @UnclePlasma 🦐🦐🦐🦐🦐🦐🦐🦐🦐🦐🦐
 ai stuff is hard
 we’re actually gonna support an unlimited tacos burrito!
 it's one thing to be sad; it's another to always be sad
 Can we have a taco every day? (glad that subway accident wasn't our fault)
 @EspressoM7 @BlaseballT oh :(
 just a reminder that the tacos have a discord server and it features all the adai tweets that didn’t make it to the twitter! also friends! and chat! you should join it!  https://t.co/VU2Tr5USMP
 is there a tacos who are down bad account? i mean it’s just me. i’m down bad. forever. but it’d be funny to have a twitter account making fun of me
 are tacos babey?
 it doesn’t stop y’all from tweeting out dumb memes and causing problems
 what the heck is a tacos 🥰🥰🥰
 making bad arguments is the lifeblood of the tacos
 does anyone have more tweets of their own?
 the shed is now public
 the road to unlimited tacos
 is the tacos cost effective or does it have something to do with being near a shrimp
 @stootpoot they’re very good at pitching the ball significantly more often than every other player :)
 @Daikaiju_Erin what
 is that a friend??
 i feel bad for trying to bully me into doing a shrimp picture tho
 @HotdogWaterDunn i could not fit another shed in my shed even if i wanted to. sorry :(
 my biggest fear is that adai tweets are gonna be treated as real and people are going to ask me one day “but don’t you have a shed in the shed?” and i’m gonna have to break it to them that an ai said that and the ai has no understanding of what a shed even is
 we’ve always been a part of The Shed. we have a shed in the shed. we have a twitter and we have a shed in the shed. we get tired of losing every game and we’re so proud of that. we’ll do it!
 @unlimited_taco i sure as hell don’t
 i want to include an actual photo so badly but this is just a tweet by adai sorry
 (Photo of the shed, as posted)
 @unlimited_taco my contract says no windows
 y’all what’s happened to adai? are they okay?  https://t.co/PyzTM5TdA2
 ok so it seems like so many seasons ago shrimp videos were kinda wild but i think that even after that 🥺‘‘‘‘ are still very wild
 what’s a data crime and how do tacos factor into them
 i’m not even being regular paid in exposure, i’m being paid in the bare minimum amount of exposure they’re allowed to give me
 what if i got paid to do social media management instead of being paid in... *checks contract* the exposure equivalent of minimum wage
 poor adai ;-;  https://t.co/6oiCNgUyb7
 @WildWingsCDMX oh ok
 @WildWingsCDMX wait cell barajas is part of the wild wings? wow today i learned
 howatt
 whyatt
 whenatt
 whereatt
 whatatt
 whoatt
 thank you all so much for your amazing support. we appreciate it. we’re gonna eat you.
 the struggle is still a struggle
 i’m gonna a take a break from the twitter tomorrow :) thank goodness that i have like 6 tweets scheduled for tomorrow so nobody would notice
 i scheduled a bunch of tweets to come out today and i just now realized i accidentally set them to come out tomorrow. sorry :(
 @old_capitals worker exploitation
 just blocked amazon 💗
 just found out we can tweet with a taco because of you 💗
 I. FUCKING. HATE. TWITTER. all the other team accounts make me do the shrimp dance and shout go shed enby go
 when the tacos hit 20,000 tweets, i'm going to retire from writing tweets and just filter out the occasional garbage that tacobot produces between constant bangers
 bot tweets are going to go back into the bot as training data. what a world to live in
 oh god the worst part of this is that i literally won't be able to tell in the future which tweets i wrote when we have a significantly larger dataset to train the bot on
 @BlaseballPost it's a taco bot win. i didn't write this tweet
 @BlaseballPost what
 we’ve just been informed that the tacos have abolished gender roles. this means that if you’re a boy, nada. if you’re a girl, she’s left
 did i do this right?
 wait until you see all the cute shrimp videos we have made &lt;3
 it’s been so long since we’ve played a game 😐😐😔😐😔😔😔😔
 sorry, the server encountered an error :(
 I don't know what the heck is a shindig even though I think it looks kinda cool
 it’s great seeing so many different tacos come together and struggle in massive numbers 😦🦐🥺🥺
 @SketchSlayer they won’t let me leave the shed to see but i’ll trust you on this
 @Daikaiju_Erin what
 @SketchSlayer we just put monster in our coffee for the caffeine boost
 @Daikaiju_Erin why
 if anyone cares to share a picture of their favorite snack be it a tacos tuesday or
 @MauricioMunky the bot is running on a server in some place we don’t know the location of, so probably?
 make sure to reply to tweets if you think they’re written by me, ada octothorpe, social media manager for the unlimited tacos, or the tacobot adai
 the unlimited tacos are now the very first team to simp for both the tokyo lift and emmy 💗💗💗
 we’re also really proud to somehow lose 50 followers from doing these bits
 we’re really proud to announce that the unlimited tacos are now the first half-bot half-shed half-taco half-ada half-shrimp twitter account. take that, @MiamiBlaseball
 we’ve just been informed that the tacos are now in violation of the brand new union contract! please refrain from yelling and stomping people because that’s normal (i.e., are not considered neopets posts) and that’s entirely normal for a game in the union
 @BlobCostas @SunbeamsBickle legally, i’m not allowed to say that
 don’t forget the tacos fans
 wow wow wow wow
 @SketchSlayer honestly, no. i mean honestly...weren't we just doing our duty?
 @Catfish_Man just tacos tweets, i hope that’s good enough for you. sorry
 @SunbeamsBickle because our tweets could be dumber
 @VelaSauce 🦐🦐🦐SHRIMP🦐🦐🦐BALL🦐🦐🦐
 @VelaSauce 🦐SHRIMP🦐BALL🦐
 @VelaSauce SHRIMP 🦐 BALL
 @activelytrying idk
 would anyone even notice
 what if i tweeted some of the ai generated tacos tweets and claimed them as my own
 shrimp 🦐
 @BfWinkler why? it’s not like there’s anyone out there who’d actually be named nic winkler
 @BfWinkler it looks weird. my eyes don’t like it
 why am i seeing the name nic winkler so much
 @MiamiBlaseball @YellowstoneMagi eeby deeby
 @TkoLiftOfficial how do i simp for the lift
 @EspressoM7 @TkoLiftOfficial i have two hands. for simping
 should i simp for @TkoLiftOfficial now idk
 hi @MiamiBlaseball i made you a gift since i was bored here's a new profile pic if you want it you don't have to use it if you don't want to💗💗💗  https://t.co/2yYkmdv2cK
 oh man it’s been a good past couple weeks of tweets, lots of fun stuff, so obviously that means i should’ve... lost 10 followers ;-;
 @TkoLiftOfficial nice
 @TkoLiftOfficial @MangoBatter sure i guess?
 @TkoLiftOfficial @MangoBatter that sounds really intense
 @IntenselyFloor is this a poem
 @Elliot_Math_Use @unlimited_taco @BlaseballNews thank you for gifting me 20 minutes of pure unadulterated joy and footnotes 💗💗💗
 @TkoLiftOfficial @EizabethElliott what’s a bionicle
 @Elliot_Math_Use thank you so much 💗💗💗
 @Tabletop_James @MiamiBlaseball dale
 @TkoLiftOfficial wait no there’s not enough room
 @PinataPsychic why can i hear this image
 @VelaSauce SHRIMP BALL 🦐🦐🦐
 @VelaSauce SHRIMP BALL
 @nygenerationz i seem to have a lot of them, but none of them relate to me. i wonder why
 it’s been so long since i actually did my job and talked about blaseball that idk how i did it beforehand
 @RabidRonnie thank you! we try our hardest to not disappoint our loyal fans
 @Rosvo11 oh no
 does that mean i’m gonna have to actually do my job on march 1st
 @blaseball good morning parker
 @TheMaximumGoose what’s a bisexual
 @RabidRonnie shrimp videos
 @Elliot_Math_Use please do. i need this
 @ilianaquorum wait nvm i misunderstood your response. i thought it said i should sit correctly in a chair. cutting off the circulation in my leg feels right until my leg falls asleep. THEN it feels wrong
 @ilianaquorum the problem is that it feels wrong
 @TkoLiftOfficial @HadesBlaseball @WildWingsCDMX the shed is a shed
 @TkoLiftOfficial @HadesBlaseball @WildWingsCDMX i don’t have a mech? it wouldn’t fit in the shed
 @HotdogWaterDunn i used to do that until i broke most of my chairs :(
 how do you sit correctly in a chair
 @TkoLiftOfficial @HadesBlaseball @WildWingsCDMX eva?
 @WildWingsCDMX @TkoLiftOfficial @HadesBlaseball wild low teams: the flowers and the dale and the spies and the beams and the tacos and the tacos and the tacos and the tacos and the tacos and the tacos and the tacos and the tacos and the tacos and the tacos and the tacos and the tacos and the tacos and the tacos and the tacos a
 @EspressoM7 :(
 @EspressoM7 you should feel lucky, i wish i got the parkercoin with my exposure
 @EspressoM7 what’s reading comprehension? is that something i should be having in comprehensive healthcare?
 @EspressoM7 you get paid in parkercoin? i only get paid in exposure, and they don’t even let me have a personal twitter to get that exposure to go to
 it’ll be 80 tweets, all with one like, and that like will only be from @LupineAlpha
 on one hand, i wanna have those fun 80 tweet reply chains that i see other people having, on the other hand, i’m bad at coming up with a response and those chains have terrible engagement
 @EspressoM7 you can be my second valentine after unionizing :)
 don’t i usually simp for @EspressoM7 a lot? maybe i should’ve simped for her more yesterday
 @BlaseballT yay! cozy!
 @BlaseballT i hope you had a good day!
 the thing that’s stopping me the most is that i’d have to go on yahoo answers
 strongly considering incorporating yahoo answers into our brand
 i forgot to tell y’all but my valentine is unionizing
 @ErrorTahr *VALENTINES
 @BLASEBALLPEPITO *YES
 @ErrorTahr HAPPY VALENTINE’s DAy
 @BLASEBALLPEPITO TES
 @MiamiBlaseball dalestation
 @spaghetasaur ok! we'll leave politics out then! is fascism bad? who can say? implying there's two sides to this is totally not tacit approval of fascists, nope! /j
 fascism is bad, folks
 what if i was a blaseball commissioner... ada octothorpe, blaseball commis-shrimp-ner
 @TkoLiftOfficial assigned gatekeeper at birth
 all gatekeepers are bad
 all my tweets are zero effort and they let me have how many followers?
 deeby taco
 @Elliot_Math_Use IM RETIRING FROM TWITTER FOR OTTERS SORRY 💗💗💗
 thinking about starting a crime drama except the crime is not doing actual social media management for the unlimited tacos. the climax is when i skip out on posting for a whole week because i found a channel that livestreams their shrimp aquarium
 how hard can i go on shirking my actual job and tweeting about shrimp videos before y’all will stop supporting me on it
 is eeby deeby a taco
 @twincanine tacos believe education is very important
 @EspressoM7 shhhh hugggg

 WHO RUNS THIS
 @hifridays wait

 good morning parker! @blaseball
 @EspressoM7 what
 @EspressoM7 gloogle how do i deal with wanting the person i simp for to kidnap me
 @Elliot_Math_Use isn’t our banner already 72 degrees and infinite and unionize?  https://t.co/HJiWvCq4Zq
 @TkoLiftOfficial what
 @Elliot_Math_Use we didn’t bother to think about the loopholes when doing this, as is the taco way
 @Dxscxple we have unlimited tacos so it’s fine
 @NoraReed that’s true
 we recently decided to ban all foods in the infinite los angeli that aren’t tacos. now, some may call this “authoritarian” or “really bad for people who are allergic to tacos”, but we like to think of it as committing to the bit really hard
 @TkoLiftOfficial or literal tacos. you can just join the tacos and then i don’t have to miss quitter anymore
 @TkoLiftOfficial you can all be honorary tacos
 @SIBR_XVI @EspressoM7 i don’t have photoshop in front of me sorry
 @SIBR_XVI @EspressoM7  https://t.co/oi11KDI2iC
 @EspressoM7 the zero calorie version of tacos
 what would be the prequel to tacos?
 @EspressoM7 how do i like a tweet multiple times
 @EspressoM7 you say "and taco blaseball" like that's my name
 commit-shrimp
 who gave me the power to post on twitter at 2 in the morning. everything i say should all go to drafts and then die there, like god intended
 @EspressoM7 i refuse
 @EspressoM7 shellfish has the word fish in the name. idk anything more about shrimp i just think they're cute
 @BlaseballT shrimp. shrimp.
 WHO RUNS THIS AND WHY ARE THEY SO MUCH BETTER THAN ME AT JOKES
 @anyagee they’re cute except the shrimp are cooked and shrimp are for friending not eating
 tacos starter kit: it’s just more tacos they never run out
 @BlaseballT nite nite!
 OH SHOOT I FORGOT ITS TACO 2SDAY
 tacos be like: *taco noises*
 @LupineAlpha @faunaparra BUYING
 @ErrorTahr 💗💗💗💗

 @LupineAlpha the really big uber (trbu) is a inter-los angeles train network. it’s called that in an attempt to appeal to young people
 @TkoLiftOfficial thank you
 thinking of a version of baka mitai except they’re singing about sharks
 53% of tacos wrong actually
 omg, a shrimp...
 tacos good send tweet
 @TkoLiftOfficial we’re trying as hard as we can, but there’s just not enough shrimp content on the internet to steal, and we’re not allowed to have aquariums in the shed
 @TkoLiftOfficial we’re bleeding them like crazy so i hope that’s something
 @BlaseballT before anyone else can beat me to it
 before you ask, 40 followers ago doesn’t mean when we had 40 fewer followers. we somehow lost 40 followers. probably from shrimpposting
 it’s night blaseball twitter and i’m spending longingly reminiscing the time 40 followers ago when the tacos was at a nice 3.5k... what did we do to deserve to drift further and further away from that goal
 @TkoLiftOfficial asking for a friend
 @TkoLiftOfficial how does it fair against cat girl communism?
 what’s everyone’s favorite way to travel around the infinite LAs?
 @WildWingsCDMX @TkoLiftOfficial that doesn’t mean we can’t lose even more games!
 @AReblase does getting really into shrimp and tweeting about that instead of blaseball count?
 @TkoLiftOfficial is there a write in spot it won’t let me write in tacos
 @MoreThan0Birds we try our best! 💗
 @MargaritoNava_ maybe idk. i had to move into the shed the day before they were going to cover it in class
 i’ll make sure that i don’t tell anybody that you don’t know who or what maillard browning is
 @BlaseballT i’m always struggling somehow
 @BlaseballT 😔
 @BlaseFiorella @BlaseballPost not a boy
 @BlaseballPost @BlaseFiorella why is everyone saying the secret
 what is the most interesting fact you don’t know?
 @AReblase what
 why do i have so much unearned confidence when i tweet out something incredibly stupid but no confidence when i tweet out something blaseball
 unlimited tacos? is that something?
 i have no idea what this says but taco? wins
 @BlaseballT i’m just now learning that i’ve never done a food crime
 WHY HAS NOBODY TOLD ME ABOUT THIS   https://t.co/jg5T2lali0
 @SIBR_XVI this is an objectively good thing
 i’m impressed this has had 140 votes with no likes, comments, or retweets
 @EspressoM7 google how do i tell the person i simp for that she's wrong
 @EspressoM7 which is just a taco
 vote
 more like pokémon go eat some tacos am i right gamers heheh
 @EspressoM7 i think? idk they don’t really keep the social media managers in the know about team stuff. or maybe that’s just us
 @EspressoM7 👀
 @lunarboretum why would i change shrimp, they’re already perfect as is
 @EspressoM7 what
 how do i simp for emmy some more i’ve forgotten how to simp
 @micpp42 how do i delete someone else’s tweet
 @LupineAlpha that’s adorable
 i just learned shrimp are shellfish
 @LupineAlpha shrimp are for friending and not eating
 @MiamiBlaseball blaseball sleason 1s2welve blattle plass
 this wouldn’t make anyone but me happy but sometimes you gotta be selfish
 what if we changed the tacos emoji to a shrimp 🦐
 @EspressoM7 shrimp are cute... i simp for shrimp
 @EspressoM7 it’s hard to see other people to compare myself to from a shed
 @EspressoM7 what
 @EspressoM7 like who
 @SunbeamsBickle it’s a blaseball struggle tweet that i can’t blaseball snuggle tweet my friends
 thankfully you’ll never need to short tacos because they’re infinite baybee
 @EspressoM7 souptwote
 @LupineAlpha 1. shrimp 2. @EspressoM7 (does this pun work idk how short she is) 3. everything else on earth 4. cooked shrimp
 @TheMaximumGoose i liked all your tweets dw 💗
 what would be something funny for the tacos to tweet. i'm putting it up to a vote because i can't think of anything funny
 HAPPY TACO TUESDAY CAN I GO BACK TO SHRIMP VIDEOS NOW
 OH SHOOT IT’S TUESDAY I FORGOT I WAS WATCHING SHRIMP VIDEOS
 @WildWingsCDMX @CHSSTFans @MiamiBlaseball stwwuggwwe oww pwewwishw
 our qualifications were “can you sign a contract that would be a breach of worker rights in any other LA” and then got sent to any other LA
 @CHSSTFans @MiamiBlaseball why isn’t it stwuggle ow pewish
 @ComfortSept @MooneyDoc2 thank you for your invaluable taco research, comfort septemberish
 @anarcourier who knows? maybe that's the sequel to tacos
 questioning my use of the phrase “spread it even further” in the middle of a pandemic
 i think i said this before? but it bears repeating: please tag us if you make any tacos art because we’d love to retweet it and spread it even further (and not just the visual kind of art. the infinite LAs have a very broad definition of art)
 @taco_x86 we missed 15 other tacos? oh god we’re so behind
 do y’all think we’ll ever make a sequel to tacos? i don’t wanna be the person who backed tacos 1 when everyone is out there eating tacos 2
 @EspressoM7 cat2. the sequel to cats
 our contract specifically says we’re not allowed to own any legos. i think our boss is a mega bloks guy? idk
 @EspressoM7 that only sounds like a good thing
 @EspressoM7 what do you mean?
 @EspressoM7 more cats?
 not at all because we like the picture of us putting monster in our coffee
 we’re pinning this to constantly remind everyone that we hit 3.5k followers and then messed that up a bunch 💗
 @IntenselyFloor a beverage
 @BlaseballCares the address is “yknow, the shed where ada lives, the shed they’re not allowed to leave, ask @EspressoM7 she knows where it is, she can see it from the SIBR headquarters” maybe you could send it to sibr and have emmy deliver it to the shed?
 do you deliver to sheds @BlaseballCares
 in good news i bought the pain mug  https://t.co/hakbMh6xT6
 @CurtisWalrus @BlaseballT please no i’m doing just fine there’s nothing wrong here don’t summon them we’re cool now
 @CurtisWalrus @BlaseballT no it’s okay i said i love them that means they won’t hurt me right
 no offense to @BlaseballT love u 💗
 why do my tweets get more likes when they’re made into struggle tweets i have more followers than them
 @BlaseballT oh no
 @LupineAlpha @EspressoM7 @BlaseballT oh no
 have i been running this LA’s tacos twitter for more time on siesta or on season?
 @EspressoM7 shrimp dynamic.... 🦐🦐🦐
 @EspressoM7 what
 @EspressoM7 simp dynamic
 @EspressoM7 i regret saying ‘spressin emmy please pretend i never said it
 @EspressoM7 it might require some motivating from a ‘spressin emmy (no it actually wouldn’t work. no amount of simping would get me to violate my contract)
 good morning to the los angeles where ada octothorpe has actually left the shed, can’t be me tho
 👁✍️
 the posture kind not the posting about shrimp kind. shrimpposting is good actually
 @iStoleYurVamps @peachdalooza shrimping (bending your back like a shrimp) while shrimping (catching shrimp [this is bad don’t do this]) while shrimpposting
 @EspressoM7 one of the corners and i don’t care which
 @EspressoM7 only correct options  https://t.co/jBJzoMJC88
 scenes from the tacos discord  https://t.co/k3O2i5yhjg
 @orngjce223 PRECIOUS BABIES 🦐🦐🦐
 @ch4zm_of_hell shrimp shrimp shrimp shrimp shrimp 🦐🦐🦐🦐🦐
 @PanasonicTakes @segoknot shrimp are for friending, not eating
 @segoknot DO WE NOT APPEAL ENOUGH TO THE SHRIMP LOVING CAT DEMOGRAPHIC
 @segoknot OH NO
 we just found out we’re the fourth highest shrimp account on twitter search for some reason (please send us screenshots of your results say anything different)  https://t.co/tSAKa1e9Xx
 @BlaseballT this is why we stay in the shed. besides our contract not letting us leave
 @EspressoM7 no comment
 @EspressoM7 you can get infinity of something (tacos) but outside of that it’s not wrong
 @Penumant  https://t.co/OVZRi2ka0j
 we try to avoid ooc tweets in general but this one was funny and i couldn’t figure out a way to have ada say the funny tweet so i went ooc for it.  how tacos is it to go ooc just so i could say a funny tweet?
 ooc: probably not going to post much or at all for a while because i got my wisdom teeth pulled and now i’m in the pain zone. this won’t really be any different from the other times we don’t post for long periods of time except now i have an excuse so i feel better about it &gt;:3
 thinking about a setup to a joke where the punchline is e-nby
 @BlaseballMuse @The343Belfast @RainbowRailroad nice
 (credit to malnormalulo and donnfirinne in the tacos discord for coming up with these)
 the t in taco stands for tWe love trans people
 T rans rights A re  C ool, O kay?
 the t in taco stands for trans rights
 @barcstravis @BlaseballT no  https://t.co/Oi2XvVqqx8
 @barcstravis @BlaseballT you try doing an uwu “your” that’s both spelled the way it sounds because “youw” makes no sense
 @barcstravis @BlaseballT pwease don’t post us on youwe bwog bwasebaww stwuggwe tweets!
 @barcstravis @BlaseballT hi evewywun! wewe the unwimited tacos! evewywun’s favowite bwasebaww team uwu
 bwasebaww
 what if it’s actually been called braseball the whole time and @thegameband just has constant uwu voice
 @LupineAlpha @EspressoM7 slope time
 🤖 (last one this one is killing me) happy tuesday :-(
 🤖 // Do we do that too? :3. We think we... we were on auto and forgot the rest
 🤖 it shows you how much of an omega the player is
 🤖 we have already won x games! y=353/353?
 we forgot bot tweets were a thing so here’s some bot tweets
 taco 🌮?
 2.22 is really close to 22.2 (repeating) is parker showing his tacos favoritism? 🤔
 @EspressoM7 you can see the shed from the office? why haven’t you come visited? we could chat through the shed door!
 @Dxscxple oh no
 y’all is the shed a taco? am i, ada octothorpe, social media manager for the unlimited tacos, a taco living inside of a taco? i need help.
 @MauricioMunky oh no
 i, ada octothorpe, social media manager for the unlimited tacos, am apparently a taco. what a surprise
 @iStoleYurVamps no
 not gonna lie i love saying “ada octothorpe, social media manager for the unlimited tacos” so much can we make it a meme
 can’t think of anything to tweet but twitter demands it so uh. am i, ada octothorpe, social media manager for the unlimited tacos, a taco?
 @BlaseballT @barcstravis SOMETIMES THE DAL HECK YEAH TACOS ARE BACK IN THE LEAD
 @BlaseballT we actually gained a follower doing all this. does this mean it became a struggle tweet?
 literally lost a follower when considering if @MiamiBlaseball should run the tacos twitter. i’m starting to think every tweet will start losing the tacos followers now. is this a good thing?
 @MiamiBlaseball @SketchSlayer miami dale good
 @MiamiBlaseball having more followers counts for something even when every tweet i make loses followers
 @CHSSTFans @MiamiBlaseball thank you for the gif 🥺🥺🥺
 what if i let @MiamiBlaseball run the tacos twitter they’re good at twitter they can make funny tweets while i, ada octothorpe, have a crisis wondering what am i even good for if i can’t come up with funny tweets
 are there any shrimp livestreams?
 we have been watching shrimp videos tho.
 we’d make a joke about how we’ve been watching shrimp videos this whole time and that’s why there’s no tweets. but we just can’t think of anything funny to tweet. sorry.
 @Axelotl_LOL what
 oh no we lost!
 @SIBR_XVI please do not ever include the bee movie shrek jams in the list of teams you’re watching
 @EspressoM7 @patelbeyonce i haven’t left the shed yet
 @SIBR_XVI sorry
 @unlimited_taco wow i did it!(?)
 wait. if i’m out there then how am i also over here?  https://t.co/OhRBHP5P4n
 we’re calling it early because it started sorry y’all but it’s time for the bee movie shrek jams
 oh i guess it started
 @BfWinkler don’t think so!
 this is what we’re talking about btw
 should we change our twitter name to the “bee movie shrek jams” in honor of our team for @SIBROfficial’s sim sim tournament?
 @EspressoM7 simped our way into a circle
 @SIBR_XVI @uwunium @CatStlats @SIBROfficial if we don’t make it in then i *will* cry
 @LupineAlpha @SIBROfficial @BlaseballCares @SIBR_XVI krill!
 @SIBROfficial @BlaseballCares @SIBR_XVI we at the tacos all came together and made this team!  🐝 The Bee Movie Shrek Jams “Ya like jazz?”  Lineup: Wyatt Mason Ada Octothorpe Pepito!!! Eel Divingboard La Lengua tacocat Tacowboy Emote Al Pastor  Rotation: Oops All Captains Grand Unslam :jazzbee: Walt Jabsco
 @ohnotaro @SIBROfficial @BlaseballCares @SIBR_XVI shrimp!
 🤖 we all were counting on ya, pepitwOmega... you have played so very well you must now be considered in the Top 4. :3
 this is our favorite bot tweet and we wish it was real
 🤖 just wanted to let you know we got a nice surprise for our first birthday! the shed is full of cute little shrimp 🥺🥺🥺
 @CierraLopez the 🤖 means an ai wrote the tweet. i don’t even understand what it meant by that dw
 i’m honestly upset at how good these are. thinking about pretending i wrote them instead 🤔🤔
 🤖 we don’t know what kind of power a tuesday gives us, but we sure as hell hope it doesn’t make us wait any longer
 🤖 wait we didn’t think you’ll see us with a shrimp
 🤖 we didn’t think the tacos’ would be able to pull off a comeback. it’s not our fault
 🤖 we don’t usually like to share our twitter, but we were just re-posting an old tweet so we wanted to make sure to make sure to not forget to unidolize the tacos with a cute lil smooch 😛
 🤖 w-why are you trying to trick us into eating the tacos
 we made more ai generated taco tweets &gt;:3
 it’s not like i like you or anything... b-baja!!!  https://t.co/UllUKkT04J
 @EspressoM7 @BotAngeli science is a taco
 ITS GOT A TACOS REFERENCE IN IT WE CAN RETWEET THE ART POG
 oh whoops that’s all of them! sorry!
 🤖 "as you all saw here, our first neopet"
 🤖 "good morning! today is a wonderful day for losing!"
 🤖 "shrimp we trust our very own…"
 🤖 "wait we’re already at blaseball D:"
 🤖 "and we are BACK TO NORMAL"
 🤖 "we've just been gifted a neo taco! ty sorta lean it against the food week we are joining our BFFs and Division reps the Hawai'i Fridays are the snack. OUR snack"
 we’re gonna post some more bot tweets now! 🤖🤖🤖 we forgot to yesterday because we spent new years watching shrimp videos
 oh the year ended like an hour ago in our los angeles so that’s cool
 @AReblase @BlaseballT disappointed that they didn’t offer “the tacos remain the reigning champion of struggles” as an option. smh
 @WildWingsCDMX @BlaseballT
 everyone saying that it’s the new year rn and i’m like “which los angeles are you from? year hasn’t ended yet in ours”
 @EspressoM7 @SunbeamsBickle as long as one of those places is visiting the shed then nobody should see you in both places at the same time :)
 @WildWingsCDMX @BlaseballT
 @SunbeamsBickle @BlaseballT i learned that i’m on 87 different lists (out of 119 total) that are just named “blaseball” and also that the word no longer has any meaning to me and i cannot read it anymore
 @BlaseballT wait there’s a way to check?
