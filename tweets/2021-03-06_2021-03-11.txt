 @rifflesby @animusmechanica @blaseball_jazz we’re doing idol shenanigans again because our hubris is too high and apparently we weren’t burned badly enough from the snackrifice
 #tacoganda  https://t.co/b5RJNGrJPM
 alright alright. being good at blaseball was a really funny prank for this season. now that we did our funny prank we'll go back to peak tacos!  please...
 the reason i've been spamming so much right now is because i procrastinated on sharing these memes earlier and i'm probably gonna be asleep for day 96 because my sleep schedule is garbage #tacoganda 💗  https://t.co/GCMsotAbMS
 i don't know what else to say so follow @ShrimpDaily because it's objectively the best twitter account on the internet
 dreaming of better times...  https://t.co/4DojHXXh8y
 the secret team rivalry that i have is always being less than 50 followers away from @HadesBlaseball (no hard feelings please)
 @ShrimpDaily i'm so sad i missed this tweet i love this so much 🥺

 OH SHOOT I FORGOT TO CREDIT THE ARTIST! art by @ garbage_g0ose on instagram

 @BfWinkler i’m really focused on the shrimpies when i’m having good vibes!
 *sips capri sun* mlichelangelos ‘bongers’ is one of the most perfect specimens of the peanut form known to man  https://t.co/5JU9j0VIzo

 @phantomshotgun the coin is just a really shitty boss that pretends be on your side until it affects the bottom line
 @SunbeamsBickle @BLASEBALLPEPITO pepitwowo
 @ashinycoin thank you for the one (1) content 🥺🥺🥺
 i have a headache and can’t think of any funny tweets so y’all are getting the lowest effort poll i can come up with

 @Tabletop_James aww thank you!
 we stick a sudoku on a taco and then set the planet on fire. this can’t possibly end badly
 come on y’all, think about it... NFTacos
 i have no idea what that means and how that joke works so if you come up with a funnier one that’d be great
 what are the tacos if not sexton enduring
 i should not be allowed on twitter dot com at 3 in the morning
 no really tho how would it feel to hug a shrimp i wanna know
 what would it feel like to hug a shrimp?
 tacos are gay now send tweet
 @WTFBSplortRadio @thebleatingedge OH NO THE POOR SHRIMPIES 🥺🥺🥺 ARE THEY OKAY?
 @BlaseballNews tacos?
 @thebleatingedge @WTFBSplortRadio i don’t know what the word “consequences” even means
 oh so the wexico wity wild wings just beat us in a game
 @PinkArachnia this question is why twitter should let me include polls in qrts
 blaseball taco the people have spoken
 @blaseball @YESPLZdotCOFFEE why does it show the tacos at the top? parker is your site bugged?
 @BFFBlaseball @WildWingsCDMX @DallasSteaks @nymillenials tacos lose :) or maybe tacos win? i mean if we have no chance of being in partytime we might as well win as hard as we can
 @zaxalrie be careful what you wish for
 @PinataPsychic what about the tacos?
 @CAliciakeyes @LupineAlpha nice
 i will pay real money for a documentary about derrick kreuger that does those cool video editing tricks with songs except there’s only one song the whole way through and it’s the ballad of derrick kreuger
 @ilianaquorum oh, is she anything like that one blaseball player jessica telephone?
 when will we get jon bois-styled blaseball documentaries. i wanna spend an hour watching a video by summoning salt titled “Blaseball: The Longest Short Journey of Kiki Familia”
 all the other blaseball teams call their fans _____ nation, can we be the taco nation or are we just going to stick with the traditional nickname of “holy shit what are they doing this time?”
 @FirewallAndrews @MoistTalkers @BlaseballNews @Unoculo @CatStlats @Leto @RFoluler it means taco baco, next question
 @OhioWorms yknow you make a good point
 @MiamiBlaseball what’s the joke i’m confused
 @joel_a_clark is fashion a taco? how about clothes
 @Dxscxple it’s late enough that people won’t opt out because of greed, or forget to do it because it’s so long before the game responds to the decision, but also early enough to have 3 or 4 hours to organize.  oh umm were you expecting a classic tacos joke answer? umm...shrimp i guess
 @IrisScreams we need to get punished for our hubris in *some* way
 @Dxscxple @HeiressChadwell @OhioWorms didn’t someone put the tacos at the very top of their season rankings? i don’t remember who but maybe @BlaseballNews can help?
 @OhioWorms that’s understandable
 @KyomiHikaru that’s understandable! there’s no obligation to take part in any of it!
 #tacoganda (credit to @DeeJayRingis)  https://t.co/bRS8Ddsz3k

 @siobhansabino pffft
 good morning y’all! since it’s taco tuesday, i’ll share my ko-fi! i’d appreciate if you helped make blaseball more sustainable, but there’s no obligation!
 @kunacottontail but then i'll have to find all the jokes i made last time 😰😰😰
 @kunacottontail we already did that bit, but i guess we can retweet it since it's relevant again  https://t.co/ztGGV187Yp
 @LupineAlpha @Leto sea slugs good
 @hifridays a hot pocket is just a taco that makes you feel pain
 @CatStlats @Leto  https://t.co/5Y7zaImzbE
 HEY Y'ALL TIME FOR MORE BAD POLLS THAT YOU ALL LOVE. IS A BLASEBALL A TACO?
 @Leto i'm not allowed to leave my shed or meet anyone. sorry
 @jon_danger @PinkArachnia NICE
 @Leto what the fuck is a blaseball
 @PinkArachnia why didn't you bet 420 smh
 NICE NICE NICE NICE NICE  https://t.co/4VLdcoGbeR
 @HartfordBlase watching shrimp videos. i refuse to do my job
 let’s hope that this is just a dale situation and i’m smart enough to keep all my jokes
 i don’t think i have any jokes written with the expectation that the tacos would win a game? am i gonna have to throw out all my jokes?
 wait if tacos are good does that mean that i’ll have to stop making jokes about us wanting to lose?
 @AudreyFisher15 wait since when
 @sqitles 😔
 @Leto @Amselina05 @WildWingsCDMX i’m retweeting it but have no idea what it’s trying to say
 i think i’ve finally come around on the payout blessings.....we should make sexton the centaur of attention
 @hifridays @CHSSTFans gloogle how do i delete someone else’s tweet
 @joel_a_clark BREAKDANCE LEACH
 @OhioWorms 💗💗💗💗
 STALE POPCORN ALLIANCE IS SUCH A GOOD NAME @OhioWorms ARE WE THE STALE POPCORN ALLIANCE?
 taco worm alliance. love to lose buddies @OhioWorms
 @OhioWorms against the tacos right? the tacos are the 0-99 right?
 @bwasebaww but what’s even more tragic is losing your organs! make sure to waitlist space warlord organ trading simulator on steam now to make sure that you don’t lose any of your organs today!  https://t.co/3XQAUrQRQm
 @WildWingsCDMX not a guy
 tigers @ the umps be like talk shit get lit
 @HartfordBlase partytime% wr here we come
 don’t even need to watch the game to know that tacos are gonna lose and lose hard
 cell barajas more like ada octothorpe is going to take a nap and watch some shrimp video ls baybee
 @WildWingsCDMX women... 🥺🥺🥺
 woah! check out one of our very own tacos streaming at  https://t.co/sKn5S3PhRg
 @mefislogger it’s okay! once a taco always a taco! at least in spirit
 HEY! I THINK BIRDS SHOULD VOTE!  https://t.co/em98aTjq3z
 @GuertaToast @CHSSTFans yes
 @GuertaToast @CHSSTFans isn't like half of my tweets just asking what happened before i get told and then i make a joke about what happened? i'm literally unaware of everything that happens in blaseball on principle (that's what i call watching shrimp videos)
 @Nisrimar @OhioWorms YES WE LOVE SHRIMP AND LANDSHRIMP
 @SIBROfficial nice
 how many tweets have i written just to make sure that they’re included in the training data for adai? i’m not telling 😉
 @Nisrimar it’s not a video until you use the power of imagination  https://t.co/jjKzmV6nBc
 @Nisrimar this one is really old but the videos are good!  https://t.co/NqATZLi5WG
 @BlaseballPost can i, ada octothorpe, social media manager for the la unlimited tacos, have an interview? i’m not a player but i’m really good at living in a shed!
 we at the tacos don’t really know how well or poorly the elections went for everyone else, but it’s important to remember who the real enemy is in blaseball! coin bad!
 as a recap for what happened to the tacos so you don’t need to check the website, idk tacos got better i guess? i was watching shrimp videos maybe you should too
 i believe in you tacos! partytime% WR is within our reach!
 we have just been informed that this election has actually made the la unlimited tacos really good! this just means we’re going to have to try harder to get absolutely stomped next season!
 OOC: also i find pitching machine going on the worms to be incredibly funny and very in character for pitching machine for some reason. idk that’s just me
 OOC: oh!!! also @thegameband it’d be really nice if the team icons in election results were all links to the team, so i could see if pitching machine is still a pitcher or now!  https://t.co/jGQra2ISfC
 OOC: honestly i should’ve said all of this on my personal twitter because then it’d showcase a time i actually cared about design and spoke about it publicly lol
 OOC: final usability thought, it would be way nice for blessings that take up a lot of vertical space on mobile if there was a button that jumped you down to the next election result, a la the next comment button on apollo  https://t.co/4XvIA9BdRV
 @gamespergame @SIBROfficial OOC: oh yikes. @thegameband it’d be really appreciated if that was fixed sooner instead of later! it’d also be nice to see an individual star rating breakdown of those boosts but idk how feasible that is
 as an aside, congrats to @jesstelephone for joining the wexico wity wild wings!!! i hope you know a lot about law! @WildWingsCDMX
 OOC: is this whole thread OOC? i guess it is at this point lmao
 i also really like that it shows a lot more details on what percentage of votes went into making this result happens! makes it a lot easier to not be mad at teams since it seems like a lot of plunder and exchange results were kinda all wimdy’d
 i also didn’t realize every player name was actually a link, and since that also lets you pull up the feed to get a better picture of what happened, it’s also a really good way of getting more information when people need it! that’s also super good! good job!  https://t.co/8VSnxxOSnA
 oh, as an aside, this is an incredibly good feature to add. filtering and jumping through election results is super good from a usability and accessibility perspective! good job @thegameband  https://t.co/ZyhEhlqDmJ
 idk what’s happening y’all did tacos win? are we getting shrimp?
 @blaseball @thefatalst ok i did it 72° and Infinite 🌮 #blaseball  https://t.co/1hRoSc58xy

 the real tacos voting guide is spend all your votes on tacos and then eat them. live mas

 oh wait there’s playoffs happening today? i forgot because the tacos aren’t in it
 @LupineAlpha welp, sorry boyo but the contract says no
