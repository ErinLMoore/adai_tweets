taco thursday

no! the opposite is actually true! the modern burrito was invented during the great depression when nobody could afford to hire a personal top-of-burrito-shaver who cut it into a taco shape. really tragic that this important moment in taco history has been forgotten 😔

it’s called vagueposting for a reason 💗

blaseball is about crying over the result of the hubris you had 2 weeks ago

omg ty 🥺🥺🥺🦐🦐🦐💗💗💗

i can now retire from twitter

here’s reposting the kofi which i do every tuesday because people keep on saying my tweets are funny idk tuesday is a tired ada day

what if someone set up a 24 hour livestream of their shrimp tank i’d live for that

what they don’t tell you is that i only watch like 10 different shrimp videos i just rewatch them a lot

hi y’all it’s taco tuesday today and i think that’s pretty cool i’m gonna go back to watching shrimp videos now

i just want to have a really long title

if he dies then can i run the roundup? ada octothorpe's shrimp hour w/ blaseball roundup (hosted by ada octothorpe, social media manager for the la unlimited tacos and part time prophet)

wait when did i do that? i don't doubt i did that i just don't remember doing it

imagine having a perfectly normal day when all of a sudden CONSUMERS ATTACK CHORBY SOUL CONSUMERS ATTACK CHORBY SOUL CONSUMERS ATTACK CHORBY SOUL CONSUMERS ATTACK CHORBY SOUL CONSUMERS ATTACK CHORBY SOUL CONSUMERS ATTACK CHORBY SOUL CONSUMERS ATTACK CHORBY SOUL CONSUMERS ATTACK C

the thrill of the hunt

"gee tacos why does the sim let you have *two* rats?" "WE JUST HAD OUR FIRST INCIN IN OVER 10 SEASONS WE ARE SOBBING"

get ratio’d by plot relevance

can we be relevant for dumber reasons i miss when my mentions were filled with people calling me a dumbass

let’s give ratbat all the love we can before we cast them into the fires of hell this election for a better player

what if rat batson had the same gimmick as rat mason except macy is a bat send tweet
