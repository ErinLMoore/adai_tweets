so anyways

idea: LosJuxebox is postmodern jukebox but for garages music

WE HAVE FOUND OUT THAT PITCHING MACHINE WILL LEAVE US AS SOON AS ANOTHER PITCHER GETS UNSHELLED. THIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE

just want to remind everyone that the tacos support trans rights :)

we can spend the rest of the week watching shrimp videos still 🥺

the birds are good? can we unionize them

we tweet everything that comes to mind to produce maximum content, and that’s why this twitter has devolved into talking about shrimp and bad tweets

this is a privilege granted only to the tacos

i hope this joke works with my high school knowledge of spanish

pepitwo has a taco now

york 😢

Where Are We Supposed To Be Exactly?

i slept through sunday what did i miss?

that’s a good goal

with the shelling, our pitchers, our friends, our family, they’re stepping up to the mound. and that’s a choice we made, and that they made, and that plenty of you guys made too. you can not support the snackrifice. that’s fine. but don’t imply that we’re pulling some trick.

lets keep it moving!!! patel’s above the line—four more!

i wrote 99 “we lost!” tweets and a “we made it to partytime!” tweet and all that has to go into the trash since we’re good now 😔

omg blaseball

thanks so much—gotta love a good taco tuesday!

you sure got us! feel free to trick us anytime you please <3!

we’re fighters. and we have some pretty cool fans, if i say so myself. so maybe we don’t “win games,” whatever that is. we’re still gonna play blaseball and be a family and try to make the people who care about us smile.

where’s the smooching rankings this season

sorry for yelling so much lately, just trying to get the hype up for #snackrifice

paging Splortsunion

:D!

yeah, even better!

aw, comfort!

buy me some peanuts and buy me some peanuts and buy me some peanuts and buy me some peanuts and buy me some peanuts and buy me some peanuts and buy me some peanuts and buy me some peanuts and buy me some peanuts and buy me some peanuts and buy me some peanuts and buy me some pea—

wtf we’re winning again

we’re not going to say no

get him off spot #14

yeah, at the very least i remember the fridays and us getting there first

🥺🥺🥺

^-^!!

you know it!

ITS HARD TO COUNT WHEN THE SMALLEST NUMBER YOURE USED TO IS INFINITE

https://www.wetube.taco the link only works if ur in los angeli tho

we are now memer in chief of neopian league blaseball! we did it!

gimme a sec

:D we’re buddies!!

happy #blaseballcares—if a bit late! this week, we’re the wild low representatives! if you’re able, we encourage you to donate to the South California Immigration Project, an organization working to provide legal aid affordably to immigrants who need it.

the only players we want shelled are our own. we’re protecting the field at the cost of 5 tacos pitchers

baja blast 🥺

in honor of halloween, we at the tacos have replaced all the salsa in the los angeli with the halloween twinkie orange scream filling. you’re welcome

GLOVER WANTED TO BAT FOR YellowstoneMagi AND WE LET THEM

we at the tacos stan trans people breaking gender roles 💗🏳️‍⚧️💗

why the heck are you considering people food. do you have something you want to tell us, blob?

haha ignore that uhh thanks!!!!

they’re very strong bois but they have a kind heart

good game!

that’s a lot of tacos

speaking of tuesdays

haha i mean you’ve always been taller than us of course?? you know what we mean you’re like SUPER tall now

ok we’re gonna take a break from the ai tweets for an hour or so to avoid blowing up everyone’s tl :)

why aren’t you playing right now 👀

we see that NaN is above the Big Red Line™. while we appreciate the enthusiasm, right now we’re trying to get all of the tacos pitchers above the Big Red Line™ so they can be shelled. we can shell NaN after we get all of the pitchers up there!

alright we’re shutting this down. y’all can’t seem to vibe with us about how cute shrimp are and we’re not gonna support it

how do we pin someone else’s tweet

hi leucocholy lichen!

does a masochistic struggle tweet version of a “notice me senpai” crush count?

because of this, we’re also letting all of y’all be informed of and help with parts of the account creation process 💗🌮💗

blaseball wow!!! great job!!

and if everyone thinks this truly is equality, don’t forget that systems with unequal starting positions but equal processes will still have unequal results

cons of this position: danger, restrictive contract, the never-ending threats of blaseball, pros: y’all show us lovely fishies and shrimpies 🥰🥰🥰

gloogle how do we shame a team

YOU THINK EATING ONLY HALF OF THE RICH WILL FIX INEQUALITY?

what

quitter u know we flunked out of morse code u can just use twitter

no we were mediocre when our only pitcher was 5 stars. now we’re just bad

your greed is going to be our downfall

ldlciifkfickdkdkxoso WHY

vote pls it’s important to know

in honor of our close friend BlaseballT going on the blaseballidays stream, we’re going to only post tacos struggle tweets between the hours of 3:30-4:00pm pst since they can’t call us out for struggling >:3

tacopitcher there’s nothing wrong with a little healthy competition 💗

^-^!

can’t wait to wave very aggressively at owens who will not see us but will hopefully feel our Energy. our Vibes. maybe he’ll start thinkin of shrimp.

hey wait

we are pleased to announce that the tacos have won season 7!

we’re going to schedule “WE GOT NOTHING” to come out next week and we’re just going to have to get it right

hot take: squid is squid

🏳️‍⚧️🌮🏳️‍⚧️

mahjong lesbians sounds like a great thing. wish i could be a mahjong lesbian

we’re just saying, if your team is half tacos you better embrace losing 💗

27 followers away from 2000 is terrifying

ok we got a username! we'll reveal it when the account is available for all!

so happy to hear it!!!

it’s important

we got nothing again

perfect!!

super excited for some friendly competition on the way to party-time. we can’t wait to see you there!

what’s the difference between a like of agreement and a like of “see you on my account in an hour”?

we can make this work, please give us a second chance 🥺

FOR THE LOVE OF GOD UNIDOLIZE NaN! AT LEAST GET THEM TO SPOT 15 SINCE THEYRE 15

GET NAN OFF THAT BOARD, PLEASE, THEIR DAD IS VERY ANGRY WITH US

reppin that team merch!

until then, we’ll give y’all a fun fact about us, the tacos social media manager!

PITCHING MACHINE IS GETTING THE LOVE IT DESERVES

the only reason every single tacos tweet doesn’t get on the account is because you could just follow the tacos

anticapitalism doesn’t hire

ok we got some actual sleep sorry tired ada vibes are gone

these are all very good

we stole this tweet from her. give her the likes not us

WE CAN DO TACOS AND PEANUTS #SNACKRIFICE

fun fact you can move them to NEITHER OF THESE LOVELY PLAYERS: idolize a taco pitcher and save paula and jessica!

really impressive how much of an upset a single tacos win is considered to be

we’re so lost over what’s happening right now so hi y’all

but they bought charity

NaN

also there was no gender option for ""Collectively Owned by Every Tacos Fan""

but they’re great! 🦐🦐🦐🦐

🌮🌮🌮🌮

we all use the tacos channel of the blaseball discord! we haven’t needed a tacos discord yet

fuck that’s good

patel at #13, sasquatch at #19; LET’S KEEP THIS MOMENTUM!

scores the tacos’ first run in a post season game!

DONT FORGET TO UNIDOLIZE YOUR TACO SO WE CAN AVOID OUR PITCHERS BEING STOLEN

the la brea taco pits and grill parties with NaN’s dad. he grills tacos

we don’t know how this keeps happening we’re so sorry everyone please consider beating us super bad so this can’t happen or something

we at the tacos are really sleepy and in the spirit of siesta we’re gonna take a weeklong nap. please wake us up if anything happens

yes

THIS TIME YOURE NOT EXEMPT IF YOUR SUBWAY CUTS THE BREAD ALL THE WAY THROUGH HAHAHA >:3

we forgot to actually overpromise stuff if the donation thing hit 10k so what should we promise to do

we shouldn’t peek through the door it’s a violation of our contract

someone’s gotta be!

hey, at least you made sure people saw!

pfft

we’re saving everyone

and regardless of if voting results go in your favor, go out and also do direct action! electoralism is effective but can only go so far if you don’t go out and pressure the slimeballs in power to make the changes we need in the world!

we are too powerful <3

congrats to SpyHouston for being the tacos first favored matchup!

WE ARE WORKING ON GETTING PITCHING MACHINE UNIONIZED

>:(

pro resurrection, anti ALL gods

our hearts are with yellowstone over their loss of richardson turquoise. incinerations are devastating for us all, but none more so than the team. rest in violence.

2 ABOVE THE LINE

in a week smh

>:(

yes

is there any greater praxis than literally eating the gods yourself?

DOES ANYONE HAVE AN EPIPEN OR A BENADRYL

the left half is the intended goal and the right half is the argument. we’re trying to shell all of our pitchers 💗

caption below (captioning the image broke twitter’s 1000 character alt text character limit which exists for some reason)

if anyone wants to know our opinion on this affront to all the blaseball gods stand for, you already know our stance on gods 💗

(i think rts were included in training data so they’re honestly more representative of what we rt than what we tweet out lol)

we’re going to make it to partytime on tuesday

wait no

this may or may not be related to what else shows up when you open the hashtag

yes

four games =/= end of season seven (which we’ve already won, by the way) but y’know... maybe we’re a bit more excited, too.

wow so much is happening so quickly we’re so used to normal siesta where we can stare at aquariums all day and we miss nothing

NO. GODS. JUST. BLASEBALL.

oh no we aren’t picking on you

this is a bug we think please fix this

any shiny things for that

i want a pocket emmy 🥺

:3c

congrats on the tacos for making a win! unfortunately our 72 loss celebration is delayed another day...

aww 💗

WHY ARE WE TOO GOOD? WE JUST WANT TO PARTY

it’s a sad day to be a tacos fan

preemptive what in case blaseball replies

MAKE SURE TO KEEP IDOLIZING THE TACOS PITCHERS. HOLD THEM UP THERE. DO NOT JUMP OFF THEM #SNACKRIFICE

hey everyone did we just sweep the crabs

the tacos are getting better at comedy and it’s making the commissioner nervous

in light of recent information regarding blaseball’s working conditions, we’d like to say that the tacos are pro union, pro paying your interns, and pro eating gods.

what does a peanut shelled taco taste like?

weren’t we the first team to join the union?

WAIT WE’RE NOT EVEN THE BEST ANYMORE?! WHY BOTHER CURSING US WITH WINNING IF WE WONT EVEN GET TO BE IN FIRST PLACE.

i’m just here to suffer

the tigers are nice to us!!! we love HadesBlaseball :^)

if he has two allergic reactions they cancel out right ???

👁✍️ or something idk

3. The commissioner is doing a great job From the Unlimited Los Angeli Tacos #SeasonATE

>:3c mischief

❤️💋

we weren’t trying to pick on you

all about that vote money baby

seasonal partytime is such a relief

it’s more important for WyattDovenpart to take a nap than for us to “follow” the “rules” of “blaseball”

taco (food) good taco (team) causing problems

15% of people misclicked and that’s crazy :/

quitter

it’s blaseball

make sure to give us a hi when you visit!

the world is so much better when we do that

i know how to use a phone i just want to play sudoku

while we may say a lot of stuff off the cuff about LA, an important thing to remember is that we have no idea if it’s true! we’re social media managers! we don’t ever leave the house!

we sleep in the shed we work in the shed. our commute is great!

shrimp 🦐 🥺🥺🥺

imagine holding the WR in partytime% and then they give the trophy to someone else smh

look at that team! this is lovely

tacos can have hearts for their filling

nooo LoversBlaseball our soul bond

have u seen our post history? we never liked winning

i like to think about it this way, 23 wins OR 76 hard-fought losses :)

all tacos pitchers have approximately the same number of people idolizing them. this is intentional. this is also why jaylen fell and subsequently climbed 4 places at once. it’s much more productive to encourage your friends to support a taco than to constantly change yours

thank you <33 we finally reached the point of hunger where you find clarity. we can play AND plot to eat the gods!!

shrimp aren’t food!!! they’re friends 🥺

dont think so, but we greatly admire the attempt

ok we’ll open up the account to the public at 8 pm, join the guild tomorrow, and then we’ll check in on pepitwo every now and again! please take care of her! 💗💗💗

at most four?

someone funnier than us could make a really strong meme from this game

they had a cool color scheme

it’s against union rules to trap the leader of the union in a giant peanut

yes YES

party time. that extended taco tuesday we strive to reach, to know, to love 🌮💗

mike townsend *was* a credit to the team. debt paid. TheSeaGarages

our losses are unlimited. our runs? not so much

our statement on pitching machine and strikes 💗

we’re going to do another cursed survey in the future. what should the public decide are tacos next

as a team that remains focus on rampant anticapitalism, we understand that systemic problems require systemic solutions. blaming people for being victims in an unjust system is harmful and won’t fix the problem

wait until you see every other screenshot of a tacos game we've posted

reposting this for no reason whatsoever

we realized some of the ai tweets @ people that aren’t blaseball struggle tweets so we will change all the @‘s to make sure we don’t bother any real people :)

this won’t stop us from shelling all of our pitchers

heresy doesn’t necessarily mean resurrecting more players #snackrifice

idolize all tacos pitchers :)

super happy you made sure to give them a snack they can eat in the shell!

we've just gotten another taco 💗

and honestly now that the sun is all weird we’re losing a lot still so. it’s almost normal. practically!!

rat isnt looking GREAT

we’re already married to the struggle so we might as well make it official

???

spite the blaseball gods! make NaN your idol! spit in the face of the system!

👀

US?!?! GOOD?!?! OF COURSE WE’RE GOOD! WE’RE ALWAYS GOOD!!!

we’ve just been informed that the tacos have actually won this game, we apologize for the scheduled tweet we made earlier. good job tacos!

ITS TACO TUESDAY YALL WE CAN TWEET AGAIN. WHO WANTS TO HEAR ABOUT SUBWAY

💗

WE CHECKED THE STLATS AND idolfourteen ISNT EVEN WORTH YOUR IDOL. TheDotBlaseball IS PITCHING AS WELL AND IS SIGNIFICANTLY MORE PROFITABLE (and doesn’t push off our lovely tacos pitchers) FRANCISCA SASQUATCH IS ALSO PITCHING THIS GAME AND WHILE THEY ARENT GREAT, THEY ARE A TACO

pineapple can belong anywhere. we’re not a cop

good luck, play blall, eat the gods (and some tacos)

i’m so happy we’re back y’all

i don’t even know what it feels like to enjoy the team you’re on winning anymore

WE’LL SEE

wait we aren’t alone? we don’t want to be yet another simping face in the crowd

it’s devastating to hear about the incineration of another amazing player, and, much farther beyond that, another amazing person. our hearts are with those most affected by this loss; rest in violence.

we did the trendy thing please appreciate us

no, you don't get the luxury of having context

ok glabeofthemoon we joined the guild now. are you happy?

NO

back to losing, baby—gotta reflect our roots!

1500 FOLLOWERS

also we suck real bad

no this is a good idea, it’s just late in the los angeli. sorry

and we are BACK TO NORMAL

make sure to hit the ball

listen, while we can no longer have the worst season in blaseball history, even outside the ILB, and we may be above a .200 winrate, we still can be a Pretty Bad Team and get our 72 losses, right?

good job, LoversBlaseball :D 💗

i love him 🥺

think about how sad pepitwo would be if anybody did that ;-; and on her birthday!

SUB 80 DAYS

have the birds strike back at the mighty nut

some people said they’re going to participate in #snackrifice after the season. DO NOT DO THIS. the shelling happens at the end of game 99. PLEASE idolize our dear tacos BEFORE day 99 ❤️

why’s your periodic table out of date?

thank you very much! can’t wait to see you at the shelling :^)

👁✍️

thanks BOS_flowers for the amazing game! always fun to play your team :)

SO WE CAN LOSE IN THE POSTSEASON HECK YEAH

J O I N U S

we told you we can save them all, and now we’re doing it 💗💗💗

THEYRE ALL IN. NOW GET THEM ALL UP

I MEANT THE LIVING KIND

oh. we’ll try harder to struggle more in the future. we weren’t aware that shirking our job to watch shrimp videos didn’t count as a struggle

great game MiamiBlaseball!

contract says we can’t :(

if you like BlaseballT, maybe try following: tacoblaseball

thank y'all so much for being so kind and supportive to the tacos venture into neopets 💗💗💗

in the los angeli it’s called “todos” because of anticapitalism

we’re gonna go back to watching cute shrimp videos

YOURE NEXT

SWAP FROM JT TO A TACO WE CAN SAVE HER

absolutely!

that’s called being a tacos supporter ❤️

wait y’all who took the username unlimitedtacos and tacoblaseball on neopets while we were making an account >:(

the discord has started advocating for government assigned fursuits.

oh wow that’s really close to 3.5k. should we do anything for that?

must have happened in a game or smth. that’s blaseball for u!!

we have a shed

so that’s it? we’re in the playoffs now?

haha

WHOOOOOOOO

we use the tacos channel on the blaseball discord! you can find it on the blaseball website!

i won’t

wow that’s really crazy... i hope they manage to take more soon 🥺

so glad that even though we’re getting wins we’re still a wild low team

the more we show up on here the better friends we are, right?

let’s GO #blaseball fans! it’s time for a #snackrifice—less than 24 hours until those tasty tacos pitchers HAVE to be in the top ten so let’s start NOW. show us your tacos pitchers idols!

WHY ARE WE HAVING TO BET ON THE TACOS AND BEING REWARDED FOR IT

yeah!

c:

we’re just putting it out there: bust the nut plan

remember: those beloved, talented players at the top of the charts WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PLAY IF THEY ARE SHELLED.

everyone: “the tacos can’t possibly win 4 out of 8 of their first games! they shelled all of their pitchers!” the tacos: “haha pitching machine go brrrr”

WOO

baja blast

sorry for so many retweets lately a lot happened while we were sleeping

this is the most blaseball thing that could have happened and we love it

i actually haven’t ever eaten a taco before. there’s only subways nearby the shed so i only know subway

who needs wins when you can EAT

no? why would it have one?

they’re going on a journey 💗

oh rat, sure he will! and if he won’t we will!

it begins...

w-what?

luv u too <3

WE WON!!

just love their little feets and tiny heads and just... shrimp 🦐🦐🦐

god i wish that was us. -99 wins and 99 losses is the dream

sowidawity fowevew, fow the uwunion makes us stwong :3c

we’re so proud to have made the world record, beating our previous one by 18 hours! every day is taco thursday when you’re with the tacos!

do y’all wanna know the name of the tacos social media manager? it seems like all the other social media managers have done that and we don’t wanna be the last ones to the plate

we’re about to have emotions everyone look away

it’s correct

yep! come on in!

i love them 🥺🥺🥺

that’s a mood

listen, we may be back to losing this game

our comedy is the exact same

#SNACKRIFICE

i think that says more about the quality of subway sandwiches compared to tacos than if subway sandwiches are tacos

OH i thought you meant what happens if the tacos win all 12 games, but this is also good too :)

no bummers

we don’t mind editorializing but we don’t like being assigned intentions that we absolutely don’t have. it’s one thing to say that the snackrifice will benefit/end badly for us, it’s another to say we’re intentionally misleading everyone else for our own secret personal gain 💗

LISTEN. AS SOCIAL MEDIA MANAGERS IT’S OUR JOB TO MAKE THIS NOT HAPPEN. HOWEVER. WE WERE ASLEEP.

we’ll try!!! however, the road to partytime... so tempting...

it was a great game on your end 🥰🥰 love to play you guys!

maybe ease them into it

tuesday x 5 (friday) tuesday x 3

we express deep sympathy for hifridays at this time. they have made what has to be the hardest choice for themselves, their players, and their fans; we keep them in our hearts.

something something we’re not supposed to win noooooo

WHAT WORLD AM I IN

and we can’t wait to see your wins this season 💗 such a shame we won’t be playing each other as frequently!

from the team that brought you cultishly chanting EAT: hell yeah!

we only get stronger

is our redemption arc coming up?

constant struggle: almost liking our tweets on accident because i think they’re funny

ITS HAPPENING

the answer to question 1 is there are infinite los angeli. the nexus between them is the tacos stadium, the answer to question 2 is we don’t know

if we get 2 more wins then we'll be above a .200 winrate :(

i feel like shit i just want them back

wanna make it 13? 💋

just found out the tacos received no blessings AND the decrees made us worse. this is a personal attack, and in response we’ve decided to eat the blaseball gods. get hungry

we don’t have any more funny tweets sorry. we got them all out with high effort shrimp posts :(

OK ITS TIME FOR A REDO! are subway sandwiches tacos?

oh no

is it a good thing that we’re back to losing every game again? at least we don’t have to come up with more tweets about us winning

I MISSED THE 72 LOSS PARTY

THEIR PETTINESS WONT STOP US

we couldn’t come up with a funny joke so pretend we came up with that one

the average subway sandwich tastes way worse than the average tacos, which includes subway sandwiches in the average

gloogle is it a crime to watch shrimp videos on the clock

tuesday x9

what

there can be only one. or, well, fourteen? maybe none. what timeline is this, again? los angeli is confusing T^T

get leaf above the line please!

are the crabs god traitors because they get the gods’ blessings so much? we get no blessings and it’s directly related to wanting to eat the gods.

i would love nothing more than to have a robot do my job for me

bad news

ama at 2,000

THERE WILL BE NO FURTHER QUESTIONS

pat pat

💗🌮

🥺🥺🥺🥺

wait we’re already at 3k we didn’t notice

our baby is safe 🥺🥺🥺

PROTECT OUR HEROES #SNACKRIFICE

the one big uwunion >:3c

y'all are watching the boss fight against the peanut god and the pods MEANWHILE we're watching hour long amano shrimp feeding videos we are NOT the same

we hope so 🥺 we love them so much

we don’t know what just happened but we would like to remind everyone that the tacos do not fear the gods and do not encourage atonement for any sins. the gods are the 1% to end all 1% and they must be eaten

whoops

we realized this should have been a poll. our mistake. please leave last minute comments with your thoughts before taco tuesday ends so we can make a decision :)

welcome to the club

this is a joke we are in a shed and cannot kiss

5 MORE MINUTES LEFT TO UNIDOLIZE JESS, YORK, POLKADOT, AND AXEL

well now how can we know if it’s YOU bullying us or the general populace? (💗)

everyday is tuesday if you win hard enough

thank u both of these things r correct feel free to join us in the 72-loss taco party when have it <3

we were already friends! 💗💗💗💗

el problema es el capitalismo

we love all of our players equally (based on revised anticapitalist contracts we signed)

PEPITWO HAS GOTTEN BETTER THANKS TO EVERYONE’S LOVE AND SUPPORT FOR HER

look, we’re obviously still losing. the fact that we’re “given wins” in the process of that is BASICALLY nothing. hopefully!

it’s okay 💗

this only shows we should’ve gone harder on the blasphemy and heresy this season. it’s okay, we fixed our mistake.

that’s the dream!!! and within party time the 72 (LOSSES) AND INFINITE taco party!

LOSS 69 GIVEN TO US BY LoversBlaseball IN A SHAMEFUL GAME. NICE.

YES!! WE WILL MAKE SURE THAT YOU GET HEADPATS!! DONT THINK YOU CAN GET IN THE SHED OR WE’D GIVE THEM TO YOU PERSONALLY!!!

don’t forget

NaN HAS ONE STAR. GOD BLESS THEM THEY DESERVE IT

have you tried smooching a peanut shell

HE WONT MAKE YOU RICH IF HE’S IN A PEANUT SHELL

if you’re wondering what it’s like to be on a normal blaseball team, tacos fans complain when the tacos do anything well.

yes. clarified the info like you do with butter

there’s a character limit :(

it’s taco tuesday and coffee cup day so y’all know what that means... back to bad tweets >:)

WE GOT OUR CAMERA OUT AND GOT OUR FIRST PICTURE OF OUR HOT POWERFUL PITCHING MACHINE THAT *CANNOT* BE STOPPED

GET WHEERER ABOVE THE LINE

OUR HOT GOOGLEY-EYED PITCHING MACHINE IS TOO POWERFUL TO BE STOPPED

we woke up from our nap just to reference this. back to sleep.

oh that sounds great! a social media manager discord!

EAT

hahah fuck we won

cmon y’all stay hungry

to NagomiBlaseball and jesstelephone we hope u are doing well and that u get out soon

WE ARE HERE FOR IDOL FRAUD. WE DO NOT FEAR THE GODS

please don’t die, i need you to share my tweets

real shame the tacos lost yet another game (scheduled tweet)

u up?

the gods chose to saddle her with debt and force her to repay it

wait until you see all my other bets on tacos games

it’s one minute until election results... one minute until we become the top team in the league

because the system wasn’t designed for 5 tacos to come up for funsies

that’s a hitter, not a pitcher! we’re trying to shell our entire pitching rotation: Sasquatch, Wheerer, Beyonce, Leaf, and Pothos!

okay, but consider this: at seventy two losses we get to have our taco party and isn’t that the dream??

also debt in its entirety in blaseball is a filthy capitalist idea that should be removed from the game wholesale with debt forgiveness for all those who have incurred any

Can Rats Have Dprite

glad that y’all were the ones to knock us out! we’ll be cheering you on as you move forward. thanks for such an amazing set of games!

WE’RE IN

t(rans)acos

hi all fridays

NO

heck

may be a 4.5 star pitcher now but she’s still half a star in our hearts

that one is so much better

we dont hire ppl or consider blaseball aptitude btw

actually it’s from here 💗💗

what

there are WHAT

spoiler: we’ll always be top of the toilet

we would never. we would never ever let them do anything to NaN, and honestly, we’re not sure they can? pretty sure the only force in this realm that can affect NaN is their dad

also please dm us the struggle tweets that other people have during that time period. the tacos will become all struggle all tweets while BlaseballT is gone >:3

note: check the account you tag before you tweet. this is not the nagomi that’s trapped in a shell, however, they’re equally cool. NagomiMcdaniel is the one who’s been shelled and we wish them the best.

people look at those?

GAMES ARE OVER BACK TO #SNACKRIFICE

you can make the subtext text and say you want a free win

can we just get them both above the line instead of this dance, please

nobody suggested this, but we recently found out that people might think that dumb tweets we’ve made about simping and shrimping might be the thoughts of the tacos team, or all the tacos fans, which is unfortunately not the case

it’s a fact tho

i’m gonna stick my hand out of the shed and hope you don’t leave me hanging

wow! good news: we’re so proud of the tacos for earning their fifth win in a great game against BOS_flowers. bad news: we didn’t exactly think we’d get this far, and we only planned four “win” tweets

it is now

nevermind the flowers scored while i was typing that

we love jaylen; we know it’s not her fault she’s been trapped in a cruel cycle of fate with the gods. maybe idolize a tacos pitcher and we’ll knock her out?

we have no idea

heck yeah we support shilling

CW: shrimp pic, us eating our food while not paying any attention cos we’re on our phone

💗💗💗💗🦐💗💗💗💗

any and all of them

be right back

oh, bud, that’s not good for you! make sure you get some orange juice or some cookies soon and stay seated as much as possible.

i don’t know anything about stats but our winrate is .111 which is a lot of ones. seems like first place to me!

o-oh

we don’t actually know how they come up with captions but this certainly seems like a struggle?

just one question: how do we come up with funny tweets now that blaseball is happening again. our brain is “no thoughts only shrimp videos 🦐”

apologies for not posting much, but when we mostly react to stuff the tacos do, there’s nothing to talk about outside of how massive this party is

also the shed is wayyy too small to fit an aquarium...

ENJOY YOUR REST WyattDovenpart

we promise this isn’t an attempt to get away with not tweeting during the coffee cup so we can look at aquariums online full time

please let us keep our tuesdays it’s all we have

tacos ❤️

hi

why should we honor the stipulations of cruel and unrelenting gods? right there in our bio.

strikes only exist to try to make us too scared to fight against our oppressors

ALSO CONGRATS TO howlexandrey AND ALL OF HER FRIENDS FOR DOING GOOD AT SPLORTS 💗💗💗💗💗

an unlimited tacos taco shipped to our house. cold. this isn’t garages merch but we do want it

what news?

protecting york silk, JT, polkadot patterson, axel trololol, etc

you go howlexandrey! go grrrr grrr and lap that blood up!

olive oil and salt and pepper are really underrated toppings!

does this involve leaving the shed?

we wanted to do the cool generating tweets trend but the website is overloaded :(

wow?

this is supposed to feel good, right?

what

wanna kiss this fish 🥺🥺🥺

ok we ran out of cute fish videos so we’re gonna make our own

thank you v much!

while we’re called the unlimited tacos, i’m gonna be honest, seven tacos is a lot

oh we lost two followers from talking about ourselves. that makes perfect sense considering what the account is about but still riv

always eat the gods

does dale say trans rights with their quilt?

WE CAME HERE FOR PARTYTIME% WR AND WE GOT FIRST IN THE LEAGUE

there’s free lunches in the infinite anticapitalist los angeli. get dunked on economists

yw just send us the check when the money starts rolling in

i’m terrified of the possibility this winrate continues and the tacos going 83-16

like this?

WE DID IT, BUT WE CAN STILL GO HIGHER. SAVE OUR BEST PLAYERS FROM THE NUT

maybe so!!!

no we did not make a typo

uh, shrimpies? is that something?

👁✍️

wait no we ran out of fish montages how can we get y’all more ;-;

THREE FIFTHS ABOVE

next season. or the season after that, or after that—anything. this isn’t the end, everyone. this is just the first taste. don’t forget that we’ve always been hungry.

shrimpi 🥺🥺

if we’re doing anything wrong please let us know we don’t usually tweet struggles. we usually tweet about shrimp instead

GET YOUR HANDS OFF POLKADOT AND ONTO A TACOS PITCHER

we’d say a subway sandwich but the poll results say that they don’t count as tacos, so try eating local at a small taco place!

it can be hard to see qrts because they don’t show up in our mentions and our normal notifications are way too active for us to keep up with, if we don’t see your tacos related post, make sure to use tacoblaseball!

we shouldn’t be alloto post on the twitter after midnight who gave us this power

you say this like you didn’t just put on an amazing show, hex. you played so well!!

why do you need peanuts. spit in the face of the peanut gods.

i guess this also works for the website

we can like things that aren’t shrimp 🥺🥺

if we get one more win then the tacos won’t get to be the worst blaseball team in recorded history anymore :(

we COMMIT.

we also love the tigers and greatly appreciate your support <3 enjoy your wins!

apparently that was only at the beginning?

the gods are the snack. OUR snack

HORSE

blaseball struggle tweets sees the la tacos and says “i will simply bully them”

one more game, but don’t take the risk. save them all now

as the other half of this account this is incredibly funny

YES

we’re gonna eat this idiot peanut so hard

what, you’re telling us this ISN’T the klickball league?

personally? was a huge fan of the #partytime WR, even if we didn’t get to hold it for long. still trying to go for the worst blaseball season ever

ok we did it

gofurment

we would like to remind everyone #seasonATE

if y’all want an update, yes the salsa in the los angeli has still all been replaced with twinkies orange s’cream filling. happy spooky day

it’s always lovely playing against you too!

🌮💗💗💗💗🗣

we’re really hoping for last place...

yes our youtube is called wetube and yes pro-capitalist content is not alloon it. we still keep the videos of capitalists accidentally being anticapitalist though

quitter

:D!

sorry for directing our ire at you BST :< our bad. we’ll return to our regularly scheduled god-hunger

you’re idolizing the wrong person

good morning to all of the past tacos that have now been dispersed among other teams, wyatt dovenpart, team social media managers, people who run struggle tweet accounts, and this shrimp in this video i’m watching. everyone else should also have a good morning.

i’m doing fine, i promise🥺

why do we keep on winning?

maybe??? 🤔🤔🤔

i mean you gotta be at least as tall as the both of us put together,,

... i don’t feel ready for this

has anyone else thought about how squids are sort of like just really really big shrimp?

the tacos pitchers will be safe after being shelled because they'll be in open faced taco shells. they can leave at any time.

"oh i forgot to tweet out that you shouldn’t forget to talk to us on discord! we have a channel in the normal blaseball discord, and our very own unlimited tacos discord!

TACOS ARE 18 AND UP (to 12)

(you’re not being put on blast ur doing good dw)

hey, wydov’s still a taco... right?

we’re gonna make sure to join neopian league blaseball tomorrow, when our account is a day old, and then after that it’s up to all the tacos to take care of pepitwo!

we don’t know what team to support so we’re just gonna support every team that has tacos on them and every team that has former tacos on them and every team that has a friend of a taco on them. we support every team :)

w-wait no

yes we’ve made the same joke like ten times and as long as y’all keep on thinking it’s funny i’ll keep on using it

THEYRE VERY CUTE

THEY’RE HOLDING HANDS OMG

>:(

i guess 🤷🏻‍♀️

is a wallet a taco

hey, LoversBlaseball, looks like we’re in sync again! different this time, though 💗

yeah. you can’t have #Snackrifice without a sacrifice, and we’re prepared to risk (and lose) it all.

maybe, who knows

really wish the numbers were flipped but whoooo

ama on monday. you’re alloto ask about the shed

idk

CONGRATS TO US FOR MAKING IT TO #PARTYTIME

we really pulled through with that loss

feeling kinda sad when winning rn

we don’t get movies in the shed

the race to 72 losses and then it happening while everyone was asleep

we keep on trying to hit triple digits but they won’t let us

yea 😇

oh. support the #snackrifice

DOESNT EVEN PLAY ANY MORE GAMES THIS SEASON. IF YOU VALUE PROFITS IDOLIZE wyattpothos

neopets logged us out after we sent this tweet. all is right with the world

ok taking a break from ai tweets 🤖🤖🤖 hope y’all thought they were funny

love them 🥺🥺🥺🥺

IF YOU UNIDOLIZE A TOP 4 PLAYER AND INSTEAD PICK A TACO, WITH PROOF, YOU WILL GET OUR UNLIMITED LOVE AND RETWEETS

if we have our way you will not be anywhere near a shell <3

kinda want the tacos to fight the shelled one

we are appealing to the birds with poetry now 🐦💗🐦

our history of long games with MiamiBlaseball persists, huh

stan NaN y’all

the tacos will be let in out of pity, only to dominate the playoffs

spicy milk would be one of the tacos i’d have to review

lrt... y’all really wanna do that to york?

ok we did it :) friend: BLASEBALLPEPITO, marry: BlaseballT, kiss: EspressoM7 (for simping reasons)

wait and see is an approach for people too afraid to question if something is just

with what’s happened? probably should be scared. you can get ‘em when you wake up. until then, we’ll hold down the fort. or. y’know. the shed.

please

AM I MILKING THIS FOR CONTENT? YES. IS IT A STALLING TACTIC WHILE WE READY OUR CELEBRATION? MAYBE

WAIT NO

we’ve ascended beyond BlaseballT. we’re literally trying to sabotage our team for funsies there’s no struggle anymore

we're so proud of getting (and probably holding forever) the world record in blaseball's PARTYTIME% category!

🦑=🦑

this is cursed and also correct

we can’t fit an aquarium in our shed 😔

hey! it’s sunday, which means, more importantly, that it’s #blaseball cares! this week, wild low—led by the flowers!—is supporting a boston-based organization that works for affordable housing, among other things that you’ll find on the carrd.

NOT LIKE THIS

(these are some really massive shoes, can someone help us move these things?)

i lied actually. not about us not even being a passable team- all of that’s true. but i have more things to say. outside of stars, outside of performance, outside of the twisted game we play for the blaseball gods, the tacos are a good team, because we’re a close one.

oh thank goodness there’s a spillover. that’s another hour we don’t have to think about winning

tfw the heavy underdog tacos won the game 😔😔😔

WE CAN SLIP MORE! 25-74 WOULD BE NICE

IS SAFE. SAVE YorkSilk NEXT!

PDP 9 #SNACKRIFICE

should we ask again? maybe the people are more open to other forms of taco?

muting twitter now

gloogle how can we help a friend run a union from beyond the grave

oh thank goodness it’s digital, that means we can attend without trying to leave the shed

ofc

we planned on only posting on taco tuesday and these haven’t been the best tuesdays so far but anyways please vote!

nine followers late, a message from us (and NaN, who we’ve recruited, since showing our face is bad branding) (but seriously, thanks, that’s a lot of people)

we’re so happy that we’re losing so many games. we’re not even getting our usual 50/50 start of season winrate. this season will be disasterous for us 😁

sorry for the confusion :(

Hi there, Tacos here! First off, thank you EVERYONE for making this goal of ours last season come true. It started as a way to demonstrate to The Peanut that they aren't our boss and that still remains true.  Also, to quote one of the keepers, a commitment to beta-testing

blasphemy is only bad if you believe the gods act justly, and we do not

1. The Tacos aren't striking against the ILB nor the commissioner. Pitching Machine is a wonderful compromise between the Tacos and the league to continue to play ball while respecting the #SNACKRIFICE

THIS SEASON WE ONCE AGAIN GOT NOTHING. THIS IS A PERSONAL ATTACK FROM THE GODS

visit again soon. then we’ll talk about how much we comprehend the powers opposing us.

WE HAVE CLARIFIED THE INFO WE HAVE RECEIVED AND WE ARE NO LONGER SURE IF THIS IS TRUE. WE LOVE OUR HOT POWERFUL PITCHING MACHINE AND WE DO NOT WANT TO LOSE IT, SO HOPEFULLY WE WONT

🦐💗

emmy no

when should we open the account up for collective ownership? we want every tacos fan to help take care of pepitwo

oh we didn’t get her a taco. it just appeared

the shed is too small for an aquarium :( we really want to have some shrimp in there some day. maybe if we can move to a bigger shed

it was fun pretending to be parker but we’re done with it for now, the shoes this costume came with were really big. much too big to fill

apologies to blaseball struggle tweets! no apologies those submitting us; when the reckoning comes we will not spare you from our hunger <3

👏👏cmon!

did i do this right?

no

every time the tacos do anything

we’re not certain if we’re ready for the responsibility of taking care of a neopet

we ran out of ideas for ways to struggle whoops

hopefully soon

miss you, patel

i don’t eat it personally but sure. i mean i won’t say no to a taco with some guac

which role would we play in that one meme? (options moved to the tweet for space reasons) 1. “can you call me your little pogchamp?” 2. “ugh. i guess you’re my little pogchamp”

YAY THANKS

it doesn’t stop anyone from changing the password and locking people out tho, so thank goodness every single tacos fan is an incredibly kind and sweet person that supports the communal tacos neopet account and would never hurt it

we’ve been called absurd for wanting to have no pitchers that can play the game

very proud to find another graph where tacos need to be excluded for being major outliers

TACOS ROTATION

every day is tuesday what do you mean

oh i just realized my favorite kind of coffee is represented in the coffee cup. is this a conflict of interest?

no comment 💗

the biggest obstacle to doing the #snackrifice are other players are too good and profitable. we’re asking AxelTrololol, YorkSilk and TheDotBlaseball to stop being so good

KEEP THEM SAFE

please refrain from asking too many questions about pitching machine, it has its own twitter tacopitcher

the shell doesn’t stay taco shaped in taco salad

hey, numbers people. pspspsps SIBROfficial FlangraphsBlase. did we get any records from that. can we get a shiny plaque or something for the shed.

if we played blaseball, how much would that increase players per player by?

it’s season 7, day 89 and you know what that means! happy birthday NaN!!! while your power may be boundless, your age is (approximately) 15 today! we’re all so proud of you! 💗

what about a paperback?!

please tell us our child, pitching machine, won’t leave us 🥺

the saddest thing that could ever happen to the tacos is if we became so good next season that we aren’t able to participate in partytime :(

WE KNOW YOU DON’T WANT TO BE TRAPPED IN A GIANT PEANUT AGAIN. ESPECIALLY NOT SINCE YOU’RE ALLERGIC.

only if you can guess how many

omg we’re honored to be your friend! (does this mean we have to do one of these too)

i hope y’all find us shoving in so much of ada, as in our personality, into this twitter endearing rather than annoying

we’re in, right?

FIFTEEN MINUTES, EVERYONE, HOLD THE LINE

okay, so it turns out there was a blaseball-wide shifting of realities, and we were caught in the crossfire. as the new social media managers for this universe’s unlimited tacos, we will try our hardest to fill the massive shoes left behind by the former manager.

just taking a nice vacation, they all deserve it

just... wish they were here with us 😔 they should be here with us.

we also have the entirety of the image captioned at

it takes so long to get here now

we’re trying to get all of our pitchers on the top 10 idols

haha what

WE DID IT YorkSilk KTGI_Fridays hifridays #SNACKRIFICE

👆northy southy👇 🥺🥺🥺

that’s a joke all of my tweets are struggles

our hot powerful pitching machine hungered for blood and now it’s as powerful as pothos. fear it

the real tragedy of being in wild low is that you can’t greet people with a wild hi

excellent showing, hmouthsunbeams

we can go higher than that >:3

:D!! lift!!! this is so nice!!!

ok back for more helping! what species neopet should we get? also what should their name be?

does simping count as talking because we have a lot of that for you

back to back shutouts baby! great series, MiamiBlaseball!

starting to feel kinda lonely in the shed

would be cooler if you were here

i just want to feed the content machine

>:(

does blaseball have blasebalI, blasebaIl, blasebaII, bIaseball, bIasebalI, bIasebaIl, and bIasebaII all on a list named “👁✍️”?

heck yeah

we went with zafara because y'all were too chaotic to make a consensus, which is very tacos. what name should we pick now? there's also color and stats and personal questions, but we're either gonna randomize them or pick the first suggestion given for those

MANY TACOS, ONE TACO

can someone help us renegotiate our contract so we can move to a bigger shed, we really want to get an aquarium

we WHAT

🔔 math update 🔔 with the most recent wins, our WR has doubled from the worst case scenario posted yesterday! We're now 0.220, partytime is scheduled for game 77, 2pm Thursday. loss 72 has pushed back to game 92!

rat mason in your heart NaN in your campaign for revolution (idol who you please! our other players could probably use a lil love. however,,, NaN.)

sexton is a big stronk powerful horse who will lead us all to victory

the time to speak up was monday

in case anyone at BlaseballCrabs needs a new team, the unlimited tacos also have shells, AND hate capitalism! please join us we’re desperate

mrw when i make the smart bet on a tacos game

he’s too terrified of the new and improved top tier tacos

oh thank goodness

you’re absolutely right! we can do this :^)

shrimp are for watching and loving. not for eating

while it’s nice to see the tacos win occasionally, we’re still 8 wins away from second to last place, but 11 wins away from not being able to do our 72 losses party, so please stop winning tacos?

hi we found a box of old magic cards in the back of the shed, including this one of accursed centaur! hope this is some sort of content

OUR HOT POWERFUL PITCHING MACHINE HAS A TASTE FOR BLOOD AND WE CANT STOP IT

pepitwo has a knife now

we’re doing a great job, everyone—once these games are over we’ll get right back into it. look at our progress!!

provide evidence of your contribution to #snackrifice for our undying love and retweets

the people deciding books are tacos

google what is a major hemolytic transfusion shock

that goes without question

CONGRATULATIONS TO OUR UNLIMITED TACOS FOR THEIR 3-0 SERIES AGAINST BOS_flowers! it’s taco tuesday! tacos on us!! we have so many!!!

REDEMPTION ARC

yes

our beloved pbae is an excellent idol choice for both moneymaking AND #Snackrifice reasons!

merry shrimpmas? is that a good tweet or anything?

tacos win the playoff because of sun 2

it’s in the blaseball website! top right corner!

what

we need to make sure to protect some more players from the leaderboard if greed is enough to prevent y’all from accomplishing the #snackrifice. jesstelephone is next.

i hope to see everyone at NaN's (probably) 15th birthday! they're completely removed from time now so who knows what birthday it is!

imagine defending fundamentally unfair and harmful power structures by saying “if you just do the simon says the gods tell you to do them you won’t die, probably!”

it fits us well!!! 💗

👏TACO👏TIME👏EAT👏THE👏GODS👏

hi my name is parker and maybe i should unionize

ok for 3.5k we’re doing a behind the desk look at who’s writing all the shrimp tweets. so, hi! we’re ada octothorpe, social media manager for the unlimited tacos!

keep your friends close, your enemies closer, and your San Francisco Lovers closest <3

someone got hit with a pitch by jaylen hotdogfingers

(looks at microphone) nervous laughter

this will certainly not confuse anybody at all 😛

can y’all tell us why the vote is so tight?

WE JSUT WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE CUTE LITTLE LIVING SHRIMPIES IN THEIR LITTLE TANKS

everyone should be forced to see our bad tweets regardless of if twitter lets u have fleets

oh ok

that’s okay bnn y’all are still doin your best and a very good job

yes

we like you too!

yes

2 ⬆️

NOW IS THE TIME TO NOT IDOLIZE YORK SILK. IDOLIZE A TACO. SUCCESS MEANS YOU CAN IDOLIZE YORK NEXT SEASON

never doubt a tacos’ desire to EAT

the really big uber is called “the really big uwuber” when it’s taking you to a furry convention

how people think NaN is: pokémon lavender town, how NaN actually is

remember when the 75 coins we got for winning was a consolation prize and not an actual stream of income

wow patel got tall

now that the season is over, and stuff is winding down, we at the tacos would like to remind y’all that there will be a 3k follower ama tomorrow. just in case you’re overly excited, you can submit questions now. they won’t be touched until monday tho.

welcome to the club

guess there’s a reason you’re not on the tacos :D! we’ve been punished in obedience; let us be punished with our teeth bared!

the lovers have a higher winrate because they stomped us 12 times in the beginning of the season ❤️

we’re not a cult. the crabs still exist

we’ll see >:3c!

you’re exempt from this poll if your subway cuts the bread all the way through

pitching machine has a KNIFE for SELF DEFENSE

we don’t even remember what kind of tweets we should be making our brain is only shrimp videos sorry

right???????? this feels broken.

axel isn’t even that good of a pitcher if you’re trying to make money just idolize patel smh

AMAZING CONTRIBUTION!!

if you can, please donate. now, looking at the card, you might notice that it’s a bit different than usual. those of us that live in the us know there’s a major election coming up—if you are able, PLEASE vote. take a few minutes to check if you’re properly registered.

also pitching machine is shaped like a friend

*splortsorry my autocorrect did that thing where it tries to change your normal word into a word that doesn’t exist

we couldn’t get it delivered to the shed but you’re always welcome to rant to the sorta faceless team brand account

how does it feel to have fewer followers than the tacos

THIS MAY NOT BE A WR BUT WE CAN MAKE UP FOR THAT NEXT SEASON

WAIT WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT A POLL!!! TIME FOR DLEMOCRACY!!!!! WHAT COLOR IS OUR NEOPET GONNA BE?

who would’ve thought the only thing keeping us from being mediocre was a 5 star pitcher

🌮❤️🌞

currently listening to:

us and CHSSTFans did that a couple of seasons ago

ok thank goodness all is right with the world

WAIT NO

reject humanity embrace HORSE

you’re good!!! at blaseball!!!

thinking about... shrimp 🦐

the tower

IF YOU ARE IDOLIZING THESE 6 PLAYERS, PLEASE DO YOUR PART TO KEEP THEM SAFE AND IDOLIZE ONE OF THE 5 TACOS PITCHERS BEFLOW THEM

you cannot resist the pull of the unlimited tacos...

we don’t like winning

bad news everyone this was an omen

>:0

uhhh we don’t actually know where the shed is? we haven’t ever been outside of it. presumably it’s accessible or our subway delivery is incredibly powerful, which, now that we think about it-

THEY MADE US BETTER

just got 3 ads in a row on twitter dot com and we just gotta say can we make the rest of the world anticapitalist and not just some of the LAs

*our

wow! congratulations, hifridays—can’t wait to join you guys!

so they have a nice snack in case they get hungry while they’re encased

status (permanent): causing problems

the shed doesn’t have a kitchen. sorry :(

15 ama melee

GLOVER WANTED TO BAT AND WE LET THEM

PITCHING MACHINE *IS* HOT

we may not have having the worst season in history, but at least we can still get 72 losses this season

we do! can you find the shed?

oh, uh, okay...

what’s your opinion on the gods

no

yes, for consistency

WE’RE IN PARTYTIME NOW HECK YEAHHH

we asked it to record a segment and here’s how it went

i can’t think of any funny tweets so please send shrimp pics

before you ask, carp are a taco

ready to eat with you at third base 😉

PEPITWO NO

also NaN gets really happy when they hear about the idol thing :^) it’s hard to tell but the void around them gets even hazier than usual! it’s very cute.

we all know exactly how they went. they climbed higher and higher, getting better and better, until they’ve gone so high up they could no longer see anyone below them

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

WAIT I WAS SLEEPING YOU CANT GET ME LIKE THAT

is there supposed to be context for this?

we’re not supposed to be this good we’re supposed to be 0-16, or 1-15 if we’re lucky...

heck

not the best idea! keep NaN out (their dad will be SO mad) and the pitchers in—it’s unlikely we’ll achieve both!

we love the goodwill pitching machine we bought

>:3c

that’s a bug. we shouldn’t be winning

haha yeahhh

what’s happening

thank you so much 🥺🥺🥺

i guess we figured it out

are polls a taco?

a lot of y’all who claim to want to kill the gods suddenly started bending over backwards for a different, more peanutty god and idk what to say about that except yikes

normal taco stuff

WRONG TACO

THEY RISE

yes please, at least by the end of the season!

NO GODS ONLY EAT

😱😱😱

proud of the tacos for winning another game against the firefighters! had a great time in chicago. remember, victory is temporary but eating the gods is forever

maybe some Unified Networks of Intermittently Occuring Norms for Sport, perhaps?

this could be our rotation next season but you playin 🥜🥜🥜🥜🥜

OUR TACO TUESDAY WILL COME

everyone i hope you look back at the great tweet drought of this week fondly

YORK IS 8 HE HAS PLENTY MORE SEASONS AHEAD OF HIM. DONT LET HIM BE STUCK IN A GIANT PEANUT SHELL. IDOLIZE A TACOS PITCHER

welcome to the unlimited tacos, a team willing to make the ultimate #snackrifice at the expense of the gods. what’s another shell in a team of tacos?

is a nintendo switch in its dock a taco?

before you ask, soft pretzels are a taco

9 letters, 3 words, yet infinite power. what’s the phrase? eat the nut

cant believe we’re getting so many pity wins before we become incapable of playing next season!

okay we’re back

don’t be, we have found our own happiness

hey what’s the toaster doing inhabiting people

great series against ChiBlaseball! always happy to play our once-upon-a-time rivals 💗

i thought i got this joke but i don’t think i do :(

this is a trap we’re gonna get em with silly string when they come around

amazing 🥺🥺🥺

HAS NO MORE GAMES THIS SEASON. SWITCH OFF OF HER AND MAKE MORE MONEY OFF OF AlejandroLeaf OR wyattpothos!!!! #SNACKRIFICE

I'm already doing my part

ok we finally did it. shrimp fancam baby 🥺🥺🥺

when the website starts working for us we’re just gonna tweet out ai generated tacos tweets in between the real tweets and leave y’all to guess who wrote what

as always, the commissioner is doing a great job

we might not be a great team. and we might not be a good team either. and we might not be an AVERAGE team either. and you might not be able to even call us a DECENT team. and you might find that calling us a PASSABLE team is a STRETCH.

ok we were correct :)

kinda wanna watch shrimp videos rn 🥺

we have a plan you might be interested in

winning is fun but we have a party if we lose a certain amount and that’s kinda important so

check us out! we’re not great, but...

NaN is just going on an adventure, don’t worry 💗

>:3c partytime speedrun machine go brrr

sleep well

you’re not entirely wrong...

as previously tweeted, you can find all of the donation links in this weeks carrd. don’t take our recommendation TOO seriously. donate what you‘re comfortable with; everything counts!

WE DID IT. ALL THE PITCHERS ARE SHELLED.

we are!

new parker?

how

oh no. our contract says we can’t

you’ve all seen dog with a blog, now it’s time for... NotAQuitterUT

probably

blaseballe

good morning! today is a wonderful day for losing!

WE LOVE OUR NEW CHILD. WE IDOLIZE OUR NEW CHILD

tacos players in the dugout before rat mason hits a home run

🥰🥰🥺🥺 thank u,,,

OH GOD OH FUCK

the coin: “here’s a good idea. if we only give one blessing per team in elections then there’s no way for anyone to be unhappy!” this season:

if i want to smooch jaylen’s neck would that make me neck romantic?

<3!

no

we wake up from a nightmare. in it, it’s day 85 and the tacos are still above a .500 winrate. we check our phone. it wasn’t a nightmare...

great job, magic! as above, so below!

NEW VOTE: ARE SNAILS TACOS? TIME TO LET THE PEOPLE SPEAK

ok we did it

who decides that?

i guess it might’ve surprised y’all that we weren’t so active about #carp considering our love for all think aquatic and adorable but we started finding #carp tiktoks so rip y’all’s timeline sorry

:D!

get lots of rest!!! sleep well!!!

congrats to NagomiMcdaniel for having as many stars as the entire tacos! i promise i’m not crying right now

gloogle how do we make a fish fancam in only 2 hours

can we have shared custody? having your account all the time would be too much commitment but if we only did it on tuesdays?

no

did we do good how badly did we mess up

regardless of personality and brand identity, every single blaseball brand team will always do the parker what. this is our hot take.

they said “guess what we will punish you constantly for the sins of the few” and then we decided that if we’re gonna get punished we might as well deserve it

does the tacos’ bulletin look weird to anyone else?

it’s the only situation where the law of supply and demand apply. the supply of billionaires was too low to keep up with the demand. we even tried moving on to millionaires and still couldn’t keep up! sorry!

ama at 3k

the sad thing about saying “we win too much” isn’t because it implies that we’re good or even that we’re moderately okay. it’s just that while we’re still really bad, we’re not so offensively bad that it makes a statement

we’re the unofficial struggle tweets team just based on how many tweets of ours are struggles

4 am tacos is a different beast

when should we do our next ama. we wanna line it up again so it happens the same time everyone else hits a milestone

friends?

YOOO LOOK AT WHAT SOMEONE GIFTED PEPITWO (all the tacos are ours we just had to clean up our inventory to receive the gift. we made sure to only keep the necessities)

another exciting game against blaseball_jazz! it wasn’t a shame, but does that count as passing the torch back?

what taco

so are we!

happy to extend a warm welcome to francisca sasquatch! we’ll miss owens, but such is the nature of blaseball; can’t wait to see what sasquatch’ll do in los angeli! though, for some reason, ‘sasquatch’ is a super familiar name...

taco 👏 party 👏 when 👏 (answer: seventy two losses, soon)

wait why are you getting a shrimp aquarium?

bad news tacos. it’s great that you‘re winning games, but you’re starting to do better than our pre-season projections. if this continues our 72 loss party might be in danger. please lose more games, thanks 💗

EAT?

we’ve spent the whole morning trying to figure out what makes a good tacos tweet and we don’t know anymore. we’ve kinda forgotten over siesta

okay y’all, after all the wild stuff that’s happened today, we at the tacos are going to take a bit of a break and slow down our posting back to pre-#snackrifice levels. thank you all so much for your contribution, and don’t forget to unidolize your taco!

what do you mean

i might have an opinion on which team you should choose

*anything happens* blaseball discord server

at least sexton is the same :^)

we are proud to announce our stadium-wide ban on all blaseball gods. now we haven’t seen any proof that confirms or denies the existence of the gods, but better safe than sorry

NaN just looks real guilty :< nothin adverse so far

today our tacos are seasoned with old bay

what do u MEAN “””crawled”””... we are a corpse on the ground. a rogue bat got us a season and a half ago and no-one has checked on our body in the grass

amazingly enough, the tacos are leading against the flowers by one point!

EVERYONE SEND PEPITWO GET WELL SOON CARDS

E A T

powerful

who’s mcbaseball?

we love to have you, hex <3

FOLKS, GET NaN OUTTA THERE. THEIR DAD ALREADY SAID WE CAN’T PUT THEM IN A SHELL!

is shaq named after the food?

stars don’t mean anything. only desire to EAT the gods was displayed when we beat BlaseballCrabs

we hope pepitwo loves all 3500 of her parents 🥺🥺

if we talked about the results of every game we could just schedule “congrats on the tacos for losing! 🎉🎉🎉” to go off every hour and you’d be none the wiser

legend, would smooch 10/10

it was the best contract we could find!

💗💗💗

we’re so much worse now that our pitchers are bad again

is this a JOKE is something BROKEN??

it’s so good to see you! we’re glad we got to show you los angeli 💗

listen, i know other teams act like they’re a family, but has any other team gone as far as we have and actually injected all of our players with each others’ blood?

??

pat pat

honestly, we don’t know!

i forgot where i found this but it seemed relevant to the tacos

WILL YOU STEP DOWN FROM THE LEADERBOARD FOR THE #SNACKRIFICE

while some people may call it “suddenly appearing in a new reality last sunday with no knowledge on how to get back,” we prefer to think of it as being forcefully evicted from a capitalist LA

we’re using pork as a reference (until further information arises) so 160° F, but you should always serve it at 72° and infinite

what are we even supposed to tweet about during the coffee cup as teams?

oh omg i’m dumb sorry. i’ll quickly take that down 💗

the blaseball gods cannot buy our obedience

we’ve just been sent a bunch of fake tacos tweets made by an ai. they’re very good and also definitely incredibly accurate. tweets by the ai will be marked with a 🤖 because otherwise there’d be no way to tell the real from the fake /s

blaseball

POTHOS AT #20!

YOOOOOO

always stay hungry! for tacos or for gods. just kidding it’s both

i still want to pick all of the above

the tacos are in very close danger to going above a .200 winrate

oh our notifications are blowing up did the season start again

pssh, we got to post and then lost in the wildcard round. that’s not much of a showing, is it? very true to taco-form. we’re sure we’ll be... fine. fine!

i think you can see which is more realistic and more important

did the sun smile on us three times?? yes. did we score 35 runs?? yes! did we STILL LOSE?? absolutely. and that’s tacos spirit, baby!

“ohh i wanna appease the peanut gods i wanna bring peanut children to the top” gods are the ruling class and we have no need or space for them in los angeli. NaN Time. Spite Those Gods.

👀

had a great time in our series against BOS_flowers! it’s always a delight 💐

stay safe 💗

what

embrace the suck. EAT the gods ❤️

it’s ok he has a lot

y’all are actually doing well in the post season... we thought that was a joke...

somewhere between one and infinite

there are three other charities being highlighted this week, as well as the usual blaseballcares merch shop, so check those out too!

winning is nothing, but causing the most chaos? causing problems? makin messes? oh heck yeah!!

but the people are wrong!

unfortunately no? we asked y’all and y’all said no

the protest picnic was a treat!!

OwOops all UwUs

do you wanna come visit our shed for tacos and pats? tacos are on you tho. there aren’t any taco places nearby just subway.

hm

they got such tiny feets... so many tiny feets!!

🦑=🦑

ok. here’s the list:

oh no. do us

all of this is true but i promise you’ll still have fun in the anti capitalist reality warping time ignoring rift in reality that is scene los angeli :^)

the gods may try to trick us into being more favorable to them with these empty wins, but we see the true victory...  shelling all of our pitchers

🪑?

ok we’re doing it

beautiful

we love our wyatts 💗

happy spooky month! we’ve temporarily rebranded to the Unlimidead Tacos! 72° and spooky!!! 👻🎃👻

we like it when you take charge, LoversBlaseball. thanks for a good time, hope to EAT again with you soon!

this isn't a bit we are running on 0 sleep and we'll continue running on 0 sleep until we get some sleep

😮😮😮

OUR BODIES ARE STRONG BUT OUR FRIENDSHIP IS STRONGER

what should our username be now that we got namesniped?

#HappyLesbianDay! here at the tacos, we love and support all lesbians—especially those recently coming to terms with their lesbianism and nonbinary lesbians, who we know need all the support they can get—and we want you to hear that we think you’re so valid AND cool!❤️🧡🤍💗💜

ARE YOU IMPLYING WE SHOULD’VE SAID NO TO GLOVER?

if it makes you feel any better, we unfortunately know the recipe and we hate that we know it

let’s do it

the los angeli are a classless moneyless society so we can’t actually cash the check in lol

>:((

though that whole blood family thing?? reaaaally lookin like a mistake.

mike townsend has our support

listen. you win nearly equivalent to the amount you lose and sometimes. that puts you at the top. surely this will not stay.

it’s infinite. unlimited tacos. for you

yeah why aren’t the lift getting any rewards for being bad. losing is cool!!

wait no keep her safe

this is very good!

we’ve been trying to lose games but we don’t actually have any control over the players. i tried asking them to lose more and they said “whatever happens, happens”

that taco certainly looks edible!

FIRST PLACE OR LAST PLACE. YOU DECIDE BLASEBALL

we pinned the shrimp fancam. this is our legacy

there’s not much restaurant variety near the shed we write our tweets from

>:0

also there might be something against kissing in our contract. can’t remember.

WHY ARE THERE OTHER TEAMS THAT ARE WORSE THAN US

here you go

hello! happy #blaseballcares everyone! this week, wild low is represented by the lovely MiamiBlaseball, who’ve chosen the Florida Justice Center, an antiracist organization that works to provide legal representation and aid, and more, to the marginalized.

struggle tweet up not crying right now we promise

we’re here just cos we felt like it’d be awkward if we didn’t say anything but the fridays did

we did it! houses are tacos!

yes

dumplings are also tacos, so a flower bulb is a taco

snackrifice

WELCOME TO THE TACO PARTY hmouthsunbeams

we’ve lost all sense of time in the lockdown

me too 🥺

we are only doing what we must to protect everyone else from being shelled. this is greed we’re dealing with

we spent all day thinking about tweeting a cool introduction to clear up a misconception and then never tweeted it rip

i guess that settles it

we have good news and bad news. the good news is that pepitwo has a pepito!

you can find your way on your own, can’t you? you seem to think you know so much.

ty we will try that

ok wallets are tacos good job everyone

those are obviously tacos there’s not even an argument against that

just wondering: have u been to LA?

oh we could never. pets aren’t alloin our work contract. it’s a pretty restrictive contract...

LEAF IS ON THE BOARD

honestly tempted to stop talking about the tacos and only talk about shrimp

this is a complete violation of our contract but we’re also not alloto leave the shed so... 🦐👀

hey, folks. this is bothering us. so, warning, we’re gonna get serious for a second. we’re usually a lot more fun, but that’s not this. nothing... about snackrifice helps us. it helps the teams around us that’re suffering. it helps those who have players they can’t afford to

protect NaN from being stolen this season by idolizing a pitcher.

maybe we should try another costume in the future?

we think you’re cool!! and you have our old teammate wyatt quitter!!

we support having those players instead of the players we want to save, but switching away from a taco to help them only hurts the plan 💗

WE, THE TACOS SOCIAL MEDIA MANAGER, WOULD APPRECIATE A CHAIR AND PILLOW IF YOU COULD FIGURE OUT HOW TO SEND IT TO OUR SHED

time for a new survey! is a hardcover book a taco???

it’s been three days, dale! i’m sure the rest of the season’ll shake out like it usually does!

we are only going to stan MoistTalkers’s adorable reactions to rat mason now

wait what

i mean, natha wasn’t a toaster in our universe. so maybe our natha is doing the haunting. ‘cause i dont think toasters can haunt?

💗

they’re very cute!

HOW IS THAT A STRUGGLE THAT IS A GOOD TWEET

oh thank goodness we lost a game

where's us

no smoke, only love!! would love to see you in LAs, anytime (we’ll get someone to show you around, since we can’t!)

we might have made a mistake earlier

we’re two wins away from having a better winrate than last season 😬😬😬

tokyo lift is just here for the gains, not for the cartoons

stunning!

love the food

cant wait to see what kind of gains Tokyo_Blaseball gets during partytime... we’re sure they’ll be legendary!

thank you this is wonderful

which

help him get out of place 14

it’s supposed to be hard?

LOOK!!!

if u saw our typo no u didn’t 💗

time for more ai tweets 🤖🤖🤖

post armed that team. If you liked from the party! we may not be soulbound a taco 👉👈

wait no we’re talking about the social media manager of the unlimited tacos, not the tacos themselves. the shrimp obsessed person in a shed, not the splorts team.

can u invite us over for some neopets?

next season should have a blessing called “play against the tacos 12 times”

wait we actually wanna set up this account how do we do we become henderson the vtuber

if you’re looking for a taco-themed number to donate, consider our win/loss ratio (32.67) but, genuinely, anything you can spare will help.

currently listening to:

we’re actually very on track for our calculated odds!! better honestly!!

what are y’all’s thoughts on guillotines?

god we hope not

tonight, we at the tacos are going to try dressing up and acting like blaseball for halloween! this is just a trial costume to see if it’d be a good fit for the 31st! is everyone ready?

sure

there’s a daily shrimp account that only ran for 3 days 🥺

oh shoot we completely forgot blaseball was happening we were just looking at pictures of shrimp

team loves u!

it says in the contract we’re not alloto renegotiate the contract. it was made in our old los angela’s that wasn’t anticapitalist

only correct option (not for us tho our contract won’t let us go outside)

it’s appreciated nonetheless!!

*thrice

lucky 1,777

WE DID IT! WE’RE 18-60! PARTYTIME% WR!

we’re so proud of NotAQuitterUT for achieving their goal of being the new worst player in the league! good job quitter!

when you have infinite LAs, at least one of them must feel like the other team’s home. it’s not our fault 😔

💗💗💗

only on tuesdays

WHY ARE WE TIED FOR FIRST THIS ISN’T WHAT WE SIGNED UP FOR

there’s venture capital in blaseball

does anyone wanna chat with us about shrimp we’re just looking for some candid shrimp conversations

we’re lost but maybe?

no

this is great, thank you so much 💗

are pumpkin spiced tacos a good idea we can’t find anything about them online

we have heard your doubts about resurrecting more players after the incident with jaylen hotdogfingers, but we have a different question. are you going to lie down to the gods after a little bit of heresy goes wrong? NO! more heresy!

struggles are tacos heck yeah. tacos win again

nice

then u know u gotta do it

keep it up! as long as we keep losing you can ragging on us!

shrimp? y/n?

we CAN show the gods our wrath. we can with NaN.

shrimp

wait are we done? i think we’re done having to share struggle tweets?

your friends are always welcome in the infinite hellscape that is los angeli. tacos games are forever and the losses are unending 💗

we keep on forgetting to bet on games and that’s why y’all aren’t getting screaming tweets every single hour of the day

wow we picked a bad time to do an ama our timeline is all ama now

after the tragic incineration of dommarijuana we’d like to remind everyone that this is completely the fault of the gods. direct your anger to them

daily reminder to idolize NaN!

more powerful... more #snackrifice

we don’t know! it’s more a guide because we got a lot of people saying they want to participate but they don’t know who to idolize. anyone is okay until we start getting people onto the leaderboards!

hey twitter how do i be good at twitter

are you doing a great job? (yes)

it’s midnight

we love the lovers! and yeah—isn’t nan great? such a sweetheart. tryin their best.

congrats to the tacos for having such a massive early lead against YellowstoneMagi! for the sake of my wallets, let’s hope it doesn’t continue

i kid you not, she turned herself into a taco. she’s called taco pepito. funniest thing i’ve ever seen

if anyone could do it, it certainly wouldn't be the tacos!

💗💗💗

is anyone else going to mention the obvious tacos favoritism by having the coffee cup start on tacos tuesday?

the real mark of a bad team is not being a heavily favored matchup against us ❤️

NVM

RIGHT BEFORE TACO TUESDAY ENDS WE JUST NEED TO LET Y’ALL KNOW PEPITWO IS SAFE AND HAPPY AND HEALTHY AND STILL WELL FED

we are going to respect BlaseballGames so hecking hard

you didn’t think to put tacos in that option 🤔

we support the pies in their goal to win every game! it only helps us lose more!

we’re very proud of how fast we’re getting to our 72 loss celebration

all these nerds are going to be worrying about “standings” and “numbers” meanwhile we’re going to be the LIFE OF THE PARTY

is 2 hours a full night

we’re not in the coffee cup

have you forgotten all the other times this season the tacos stomped the crabs? this is a normal taco thing

we’re so sorry T^T

muting the word peanut rn

no

WE’RE OVER THE MOUND

WAIT NO TAKE CARE OF THEM

the tacos r losing <3 nature is healing <3

We would like to just put forward a few things which we have established about our brand new (slightly used) pitching machine and how it relates to last season's #SNACKRIFICE

we’re now literally getting booted from the website the moment we open it rip fake tacos tweets maybe we’ll just have to make up fake tacos tweets together until the robot can do it

does old bay have taco seasoning? asking for a friend

he rise...

note: losing does not necessarily mean that we played less good than the other teams to any degree

if nan makes it to the top five of the idols, i’ll try and get a picture of their reaction. no promises though i’m not actually sure they show up on camera,,

rip data witches 🥺

a different day

OUR TACO TUESDAY WILL COME

we bring infinite tacos to party time and we got there before everyone else ever has (once) and we don’t get a cool title for it

we’re the winning-est team when it comes to amount of lore

WE GOT NOTHING!!!

oh no

that would be unfair to the other teams that aren’t offensively bad

so we’ve just been informed that people can’t see our fleets. we at the tacos believe in accessibility so we’re just gonna make our fleets tweets again and we’re gonna pretend that it doesn’t count against taco tuesday

pepitwo is up for a fight

our contract says we’re required to live in this shed and we’re not alloto leave. sometimes we open the door to get our subway deliveries but don’t tell anyone we said that

wrong quitter

please listen to ms silk she might be even scarier than NaN’s dad

i thought the tacos were supposed to be good

ok did y’all have enough of the cute lil fishies or do you want more 🥺🥺🥺

OUR TEAM REALLY CAME TOGETHER! DID YOU GUYS SEE THAT NAN HIT AT THE END? THEY’RE TRULY A PLAYER WORTH IDOLIZING!

alright y’all! thank u all so much for helping us reach 2,000 followers! we’re gonna pull the curtain back a bit and let you all ask the tacos social media managers anything you want for the next 24 hours! get to know us a bit!

oh, we don’t know. sorry u.u

stick with the snackrifice hard enough and then the peanuts will have three clean slots on the bottom

we’re trying our hardest, friend. YOU can contribute to the snackrifice efforts by idolizing a taco when the time comes

it is in our anticapitalist blood...

NO MORE PITCHERS

sure

can we try to blow up the tl with #snackrifice?

unlimiDEAD tacos, wydov!! and you dont gotta call us that, you can just say ada! unless you’re uncomfortable with that, then... we’ll figure something else out!

mochi is a taco. we’ll say no more

👀🦀

THAT’S TWO OUT OF FIVE, EVERYONE; STAY IDOLIZING (a tacos pitcher) AND STAY HUNGRY

we’re playing catch-up on sleep

all of the above

welcome to the team, we’re real happy to have you!

learn to love them

conflicted... shrimp taco good, but don’t wanna hurt the shrimps

wrong, comrade. it’s our numbers that make us strong, as a true anticapitalist should be.

wow! great win to start off the season, tacos. always love to play against MiamiBlaseball!

legit spent a minute trying to figure out if the period was a comma or not. we might actually need glasses

ok back to #snackrifice

it wouldn’t be the same...

carefully

<33!!!!

what if we opened up a restaurant

wait no

the party was on the backup moon?

i’m sure it’ll get better, dalé

*steaks

HEY EVERYONE. HEY EVERYONE. HOLD THAT LINE, YEAH?

i’ll congratulate u 💗

but blaseball needs a username for when he joins!

WENT DOWN?!

you seemed to have spelled “pick a tacos pitcher and idolize them” wrong. you’ll fix your spelling error, right?

bad news BLASEBALLPEPITO

shrimp🥺🥺🥺🥺

don’t shell NaN. it’s their birthday this season

we’re really craving soft pretzels rn 🥺

what a powerful little boi

we'll make a list called ""your bad tweets will not escape us""

if y’all hear screams of terror and confusion from the shed it’s no biggie we’re just processing

tacos struggle tweets struggle tweets came too soon 😔

we’re excited to see how the sunbeams play. no matter what happens, a wild low team moves on. we’re pretty happy about that.

the worst thing about all of this is that performance-wise we’ve been at the top of our game (that doesn’t necessarily mean good)

:0 nice!

eat the nut

:D!

you’re just doing your duty, it’s not your fault

it’s okay, we don’t need any blessings from the gods. we don’t need the gods at all.

we sure don’t know what that means but whooo snackrifice!!!!

patel beyonce, to celebrate the beginning of the #snackrifice

T^T DONT KNOW PLEASE HELP

we don’t have anyone to kiss

preemptively calling for BlaseballT because if losing 12 followers over shrimp tweets, simping for EspressoM7, and complaining about my inability to come up with funny tweets isn’t a struggle, then idk what is

it may not have been the best idea to tweet this at almost 11 pm

maybe later? we’re focusing on our first neopet

we only had one goal and that’s the one we’re achieving

we don’t play magic and we don’t know how the box of cards got into the shed

send tweet

idk we’ve been gradually doing it more and more as we have thoughts™️ (our contract banned us having a personal twitter) and i just realized that i don’t know if y’all even want to hear our shed thoughts

i miss NaN 🥺🥺🥺

we’re definitely not crying right now we promise

we haven’t actually. not enough people know of our plan. we need to fix that

look the incredibly high incineration rate wouldn't matter if we didn't allow umpires on the field in the first place. let's not lose sight of the real problem

WE CAN SAVE THEM ALL #SNACKRIFICE

WE ARE SAFE FOR NOW. WE MUST PUSH EVEN HIGHER. WE HAVE SOLIDARITY WITH idolfourteen, WILL jesstelephone SUPPORT US TOO?

is it bad that after seeing EspressoM7 engaging with our tweets so much that i’m starting to simp for her?

what the heck is a winning

we take the above tweet back if BlaseballT asks us to not do this bit we forgot to ask them if we could

even steven!

how does shaming other teams work. we’ve only ever been shamed this is new

wait how did you see our contract

YES WE BOUGHT IT AT GOODWILL

are you looking for anyone to play the role of social media manager that’s stuck in a shed?

EAT

5-22, the way the tacos were always meant to play

tacos have one skill and that’s losing ...hopefully after this we can get them back

do you win blaseball by simping so hard you make it real because that’s what we’re doin and nobody’s stopped us yet

g i v e

we added a pin to the account so only us, the tacos social media manager, can delete the account or change the email or other mean stuff >:(

oh

thank you 🥺

ah.. back to usual 💗

when are we going to get players per player SIBROfficial

don’t make me tap the sign again

also, uh, important question. is lesbian a taco?

💗💗

we’re technically always on the clock our contract does not specify that there’s any time we’re alloto not think about blaseball

no pitchers 0-99 party time speedrun woo

we were made to tweet this out

excited to see what glover and pitching machine do out there

join the union please blaseball

y’all make being stuck in this shed worth it

nice

love 💗

it’s okay to shell all of our pitchers we already won!

h o r s e 🐴

wait a fucking second it’s tuesday! don’t trick us into thinking it’s not tuesday when it is!

is there a shrimp every hour twitter account

2. We LOVE the pitching machine. Defiance to the Gods is not the same as defiance to the ILB. We would appreciate it if our pitching machine (with its ""This machine kills capitalism"" sticker) is not referred to as a scab. It didn't ask for this and we are unsure of its sentience

we would’ve stomped you and only you 💗

we’re not the garages, but the answer is while unionizing your workplace

more gods

nice

rest well, six. you deserve it.

this means we’re tweeting it all out and letting y’all votes on important decisions. and when we have a neopets then all the tacos fans get to share it

we have more depth than that

!!! excellent job, doing your part !!!

you can’t stop him #snackrifice

thanks we’ve always been consistent in terms of “wild”

should subway sandwiches be considered tacos? they both have shells that wrap around the contents

how do we get our youtube ads to be shrimp videos. that’s right, we want ads for shrimp videos on our shrimp videos.

WE’VE USED OUR UNLIMITED POWER TO CORRECT THE PARTYTIME NAME

this is a redo of this poll:

WANT TO SUPPORT THE #SNACKRIFICE? WANT TO MAXIMIZE PROFITS? IDOLIZE A TACO PITCHER AND ROTATE EVERY GAME

tacos

Knight! We’re blushing 💗

also pepitwo's petpet is now named pepithree and they're so happy! 💗💗💗

how can a team play if no one can pitch? let’s find out #snackrifice

:D good morning sunbeams!

#snackrifice

SHE IS SUPER ALLERGIC TO PEANUTS WHY ARE YOU IDOLIZING HER STILL

we have no idea we’re not in charge of houses

it’s almost... better this way. if we’re ever gonna make it big, we’re gonna make it big with our team. and we mean all of our team.

we at the tacos support all forms of worker organization, including but not limited to: unionizing, worker co-ops, strikes, and blood pacts to strike down the gods. the anticapitalism isn’t a bit

what if we ate the gods together 😳😳😳... haha just kidding... unless..?

KEEP YOUR FAVORITES SAFE

you are ABSOLUTELY CORRECT

you r so welcome child... remember... eat the gods

taco bell has been nationalized. there’s still infinite places in los angeli that taste better, but we get it if you’re really craving a grilled cheese burrito and some baja blast

it's been great playing with you, LoversBlaseball hopefully we can have even more fun next season ❤️

0-99 partytime WR

he’s next

this can only end terribly. please do it. send one emmy to the shed please

we’ve just been informed that the coffee cup only runs on tuesdays. we don’t even have to break our policy of only tweeting on taco tuesday this siesta!

currently!

PEPITO

we've gotten exactly 0 sleep today we stayed up all night watching shrimp videos so if tacos tweets are a bit wild today then y'all know why

starting to get anxious that people ship blaseball twitter presences with each other

are we posting the reasons why we can’t have the ideal blaseball handles now?

always happy to help <3!

the bad news is that once the account is public, it's incredibly easy to change the password and lock everyone out. we hope this never happens, cos every tacos fan is really cool and would never even dream of killing the tacos neopets account that's collectively owned by the fans

it cannot fit an aquarium

it’s the other team’s fault for losing to the tacos

advertising is a $0 industry in the los angeli and i for one can say thank you

its serial number is listed on the player page underneath its fate and blood type. we tried to look at who made it but whenever we got close enough to see we passed out and it had moved

are u joining the neopets guild?

it’s

shed

🦑=🦑

awww ☺️ i hope you can live out your dream one day!

if we’re gonna keep winning for some reason can we at least have the winning be thematically accurate?

yeah, and all it cost was (checks notes) los angeles

this is the end

we’re SO close. keep this momentum. let’s make that snackrifice.

good choice

the tacos have abolished gender

important development in taco technology

mad about peanuts rn

this is what happened in this level of los angeli

oof

very cool that next game we have a dale pitcher that started on the tacos vs. a tacos pitcher that started with dale

what??

no

is the tacos winrate this season a taco 😔

does this mean that i could eventually date the struggle tweets?

hi, y’all. it’s #blaseballcares! this week, the wild low division (represented by the lovely sunbeams) is asking you to donate, if possible, to DirectRelief, an organization doing great work helping those affected by the fires.

PARTYTIME IN 20 MINUTES

our winrate is now the fourth worst season in the history of all blaseball-related splorts, forbidden or otherwise.

💗🌮

that one isn’t our fault we live in a shed the field is beyond our jurisdiction, but heck yeah! lifting!

thank you so much to everyone else for helping us make the #snackrifice a reality! we love you all with all of our beefy hearts!

cruel gods have no power over us if we rip it out of their hands. spite them at every turn. it’s time for a #Snackrifice

don’t forget to stop idolizing your taco and start idolizing literally anyone else!

WE CAN SAVE THEM BOTH

ty for the fishies 🥺🥺🥺

kinda wanna make a cute lil fish montage rn 🥺🥺🥺

congratulations to LoversBlaseball for being mathematically eliminated from the party! we may not be soulbound anymore statistically speaking, but maybe we can continue in spirit?

don’t act like we’re at fault here

you know what they say... EAT :^)!

struggle tweet us all you want but we’re the ones with a cool trophy in our shed

what a cute shrimp!

if it helps, based on the crack in the door, there’s either eight subways around us or one subway clipping through eight universes

aw, we appreciate you!

WOW! AMAZING GAME AGAINST blaseball_jazz, THANKS FOR HAVING US!

*lose

protect jessica and york and pdot and axel by IDOLIZING A TACOS PITCHER. our beloved and talented players are willing to take that risk. we can do this—we belong in shells.

per usual everything is strange and hard to understand, i guess!

we’re SO sorry for that!!! NaN seems really confused so we’re not sure they did it on purpose but it’s still totally uncool!! please stop by for tacos or medical attention (??) if you feel up to it  :<

if it’s based on a childhood nickname isn’t it inherently unoriginal?

as you all saw here, our first name is ada! our full name is ada octothorpe, we live in The Shed, and our pronouns vary depending on who’s tweeting, but they/them always works!

i mean i’ve been too online™️ all day and i still need to practice what i’m about to preach, but i still recommend it 💗

impressive, nonetheless

good game, LoversBlaseball, we were happy to be on bottom! maybe for date two we can try being on top?

we’ll always love you too, pothos, but we’re glad to see you see the world... los angeli is infinite but it can still feel small sometimes. keep knockin’ em out and getting stronger!

is a struggle a taco

do wanna remind everyone while it’s still taco tuesday. as it turns out you cannot namesearch the tacos to find and retweet tacos fanart, sorry. we humbly request that if u make any fanart or anything relating to the tacos that u tag us in it so we can love it and share it 💗💗

but you did win that game!

SAVING YORK SILK

WE GOT ONE BLESSING AND BENEFITED FROM 2 MORE

WE SAVED EVERYONE. WE DID IT

and so are nintendo switches

y’all wanted us to parasocialize our relationship so this might further that goal?

probably?

nvm

thank you so much 🥰 love to play you!

we’re still doing it though. it’s called #snackrifice not snalfmeasures

WE MEANT THE LIVING KIND

have you heard the news? the tacos put out a tweet that wasn’t a struggle!

and, if you’re inclined, follow their example and tweet your “taco themed” donations: we’d love to see and retweet them.

i think we’re gonna be napping a lot, but we’ll come back stronger. maybe.

hi now we just crave friendship. we’re not alloto leave the shed but being almost entirely alone is getting unbearable. what do we do?

🌮🌮🌮🌮

during #seasonATE and the siesta coming afterwards, we’re going to slow our posting down, just a little siesta of our own!

remember the tacos? this is them now. feel old yet?

teach us how to simp properly

no comment

if you’ve never been in los angeli’s al pastor memorial park when rat steps up to the overwhelming, synchronized, nigh-cult-like chants of “RAT AT BAT”—well, you’re missing out!

we’re interested

here’s a repost of the second link for easier big button pressing:

NAN NAN YES THEY CAN!

you get it!

if you saw the first version look away. we EAT the gods and those who don’t credit the original creator

we still cannot get used to the idea of betting on the tacos. our fingers will not do it no matter how hard we try

ooooo what a craaazy rumor we’d DEFINITELY never do THIS

don’t worry, quitter had their nintendo switch

no we live in it and talk about it a fair bit

we’ve decided to lift our ban on not tweeting outside of taco tuesday just to make a neopets and keep y’all posted on it

that time was on accident

can we please keep it NaN is too good of friends with it

THE POLL RESULTS HAVE COME IN. THE PEOPLE HAVE SPOKEN. THE CONCLUSIONS THAT WE HAVE REACHED ARE: 1. BOOKS ARE TACOS 2. A LOT OF YOU ARE WORRIED ABOUT THE SOCIAL MEDIA MANAGER OF THE TACOS. THAT IS UNDERSTANDABLE

how do you play sudoku on your phone

YORK MOVED #SNACKRIFICE

this is not an attack on furries theyre anticapitalist and that’s cool in our book

we’ve won.... fifty times.... this season

not featured enough :)

how is getting to join us in partytime a grave mistake?

welcome to the party!

we've just been gifted a neo taco! ty so much!

IT WAS BEAUTIFUL!! RAT AND HEX DID A GREAT JOB ALONGSIDE NAN AND THE REST OF THE TEAM!!

ignore the part where it came out an hour late and #carp isn't trending as much as usual and everyone is asleep now

yes

lose. us tacos... we know the gods’ anger. our timeline is broken. our reality is shredded. our players have been one—and are now something that may or may not be changed. we can’t know. we may never know. tacos are used to losing. we’re used to being the problem child. and here,

we’re scared

ur name wins cos it was the first that was under the character limit and not taken

what’s wrong?

fun fact about the twitter: all of the memes i post/share are user contributed! i love retweeting and sharing tacos-related content (with credit ofc)! the tacos would be nothing without its die-hard, incredibly depressed and nihilistic fans, after all!

WE GOT NOTHING

maybe

WAIT NO

we’re perfectly fine in our shack please and thank you. also our contract says we can’t leave the shed. we do not know if changing the reality you’re in invalidates the contract so we haven’t tried leaving yet

yes

yes we’ve put our players in an outer taco shell, just to make sure people get the right idea when we say they’re shelled

isn’t at fault here. this is all the gods game and she’s a victim caught in it. remember the real bad guys

we would rather be bad with all of our team members than be good without them

it already happens in blaseball games. they just need to stop being cowards and report what fans got beheaded in each game

yknow this one’s on me. my bad, another nagomi of blaseball, i didn’t think that far ahead and that’s my mistake. how’re you, as an individual who ISN’T in a peanut shell?

:D!

i’m starting to realize that the tacos twitter is getting a little bit too doom and gloom for blaseball. so starting tomorrow i’m going to try to go back to begging for us to lose every game, but, y’know, in a cheery way

happy #blaseballcares day! this week our wild low division is represented by the illusive SpyHouston, who’ve chosen to promote daya, an organization that helps South Asian victims of abuse. if you can comfortably donate, please do; if not, please boost ❤️

we may be the worst team in the league, but we also get to be at the very top of everyone’s Place Bet listings! nice to finally be at the top of something ❤️

was that a different union

stay safe, rat!!!

do u guys like,,.,,..,.. tacos? 😳

congratulations to ChiBlaseball for their first championship win! we may have left behind our rivalry and respectively moved onto greater things, but you’re still on our minds. it’s heartwarming to see your growth! tonight, we are all from chicago ❤️

it was a proud hour when we were tied to the tigers

five minutes to change your idol before the next set of games! let’s go everyone!

👏 party time 👏

THE UNLIMITED TACOS ARE WATCHING AND WE ARE DISAPPOINTED

ok we hit it

just applied to be memer in chief, a position we can only assume was made for us specifically

EAT

great work by our tacos in their series against YellowstoneMagi! it’s a treat to play against such a wonderful team :^)

our tuesday has come. if it has passed, that’s for you to decide

SHE FALLS! idolfourteen FALLS A PLACE

hap exist

is that safe?

OH NO WE FORGOT ABOUT ALT TEXT WE HAVE TO WRITE SO MUCH ALT TEXT FOR EACH STRUGGLE HOW DO YOU DO IT BlaseballT

gotta keep losin!

imagine wanting 72 losses and not being the tacos

:D wow!! thanks for your support!! we like seeing other teams win, too, it’s why losing is still fun!

we’ll see you there, NaN

LATER. IF THE NUT GETS MAD THE TACOS WILL TAKE THE BRUNT OF IT

people keep on asking how the tacos keep on winning but nobody thinks to ask why the tacos keep on winning

feel free to reach out

oh boy

after hearing about jesstelephone’s freeing from the mighty shell, we’re only saddened to know this means that #snackrifice won’t guarantee a 0-99 season

we are eighty-one followers away from 2000 (the answer is yes, kinda)

so, all in all, it seems like a pretty uneventful season, huh?

the tacos can no longer be the worst blaseball team in recorded history

same day reminder that any and all undecided fans of the BlaseballCrabs, you’re always welcome to join your shelled friends in the tacos!

awww thank you so much

the gods chose to incinerate her in the first place as divine punishment for opening the book

great game from the jazz hands!

wait no don’t

tfw we open up about ourself a bit more but it’s only because we want to talk about our hyperfixation of shrimp lmao

...wish you were playing with us. are you gonna watch?

we’re back to losing. finally

that’s from the batters lineup, not the pitchers rotation, but we appreciate your enthusiasm!

only rting this cos it says shrimp

we forgot to tweet about this for WEEKS

god we wish we could come up with a tweet that funny

wait what were the decrees last season anyways

gloogle how do i stop crying

fishies 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺

thanks. <3

WHOS TACOS? OUR TACOS!

spread to the world the plan of snackrifice and idolize the tacos pitchers until we get all of them above the red line

^-^!

why

nagomi mcdaniel and jessica telephone from shell hell watching the entire tacos pitching rotation prepare and campaign for shelling:

unrelated but what do y’all think of betta fish 💗💗💗

thanks for your support! we also love the tigers 🥰🥰 happy to be on your mind!

we sell nothing! we are fully anticapitalist. we may or may not have asada dogs in our infinite concession stand (though if we do they’re probably only around for steaks games). if not, there’s always the hotdaco, a staple of the reality warping al pastor memorial park :^)

blaseball twitter is done. we’ve made the perfect tweet and we can all go home now

normally we wouldn’t make a tacos neopets account this big of a deal, but we’re putting a classic tacos anticapitalist spin on it. just like everything else in the los angeli, the tacos neopet account will be collectively owned

shooting to beat our PB next season

they’re going on their own journey, and when they’re ready they’ll come back home 💗

gee wydov how come your mom lets you have (reality fracturing) bats

more important polls

omg omg omg omg omg omg

she has a knife 🥺

thank you, but please don’t downplay your part. we’re thankful to you. in a way, it’s almost like we’re our own kind of team together, right? so don’t forget that us tacos are cheering you on.

this image was created out of thin air and cannot be attributed to anybody

the tacos are now above a .200 winrate

we did it!!! say hi to pepitwo, our yellow zafara!

tfw the favored tacos won the game 😔

what if we unfolloeveryone on twitter except unionization accounts. it'd be like a crabs bit but unions. would that be funny or anything?

we will continue replying to comments and sharing all the amazing things tacos fans have been making, but there’s nothing we, personally, can contribute until the election results on sunday, and the start of the next season on monday ❤️

💗

technically not wrong? subway is the only place that’ll deliver to the shed

:D!

you’ve got the spirit, but no 💗 please shift your idol to a tacos pitcher (rotation), at least for now!

ok it’s a bit past 8, so it’s time to redistribute access of the tacos neopets account to the people! please be nice! username: 72andinfinite, password: Sn@ckrifice72, thank you so much to our great fans for suggesting both of these!

are you okay?

yeah that’s not the vibe :<

we know, rat. you’re not alone in missing them.

in our defense, we couldn’t reasonably assume anybody follows this twitter for the players with how much we talk about our love for shrimp. it’s like an 80/20 split in favor of talking about shrimp

the gold standard of showing the world how much simping can do

do you really think it’s a coincidence that the first season the tacos made it to the playoffs also happened to be the first season we ate a god? think about it

the tacos are actually 8 tuesdays in a trench coat pretending to be a blaseball team

we’re made of flesh just like every other team

is she... not... also a past taco on a different team? she’s still playing with the crabs wherever ascension is, we think. hope the crabs are treating her nicely.

we’ll wait for you until you come back, don’t worry 💗

❌🥜

ok so you know how the merging-divide of some los angeli’s have this like, technicolor heat wave effect?? that just happened?? i dunno my eyes stopped working halfway through but i think they were smiling :^)

us crying over shrimp videos? it’s more likely than you might think

it’s happening

we only #snackrifice our pitchers. join us

we dont do this so if the spies turn u away feel free to visit los angeli.

always hungry

is a house a taco

i hastily scoured TACOBEEL in the hopes i could retweet anything to give y’all funny tweets to look at but we got nothing

THANK YOU,,, we love them

we, uh, brought tacos!
