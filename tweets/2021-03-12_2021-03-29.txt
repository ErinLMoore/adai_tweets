taco baco

remember way back when we said that the only escape from blaseball was death? boy did we mess that one up

i love it and i love you

🥺🥺🥺

i think it’s perfect as it is, just like you!  i prolly wouldn’t tweet it tho

you always were ☺️

oh no

why the heck are nfts still relevant in the news my only joke was nftaco i can't come up with another one y'all

no thoughts only shrimpies

🥺🥺🥺

you’re telling me a compact disc’d this horse?

my thoughts on the recent 💿🐴: a 🧵

ty 🥺🥺🥺

yes

what’s upgamer?

coin is cancel culture send tweet

what if getting incinerated was called “getting canceled?”

tacos love unionizing

how dare you write a joke so funny and not immediately pin it on every single blaseball twitter on earth

blaseball jokes are blaseball prophecies and baby

that took me way too long to get and i hate it 💗

i'm still only 5 followers ahead of the tacos' true rivals: @HadesBlaseball. we have really close follower counts and it's fun to be a little bit ahead or a little bit behind them

tacos will be taking a break this siesta! we plan on updating adai’s training data while we’re out so any siesta tweets are prolly gonna be written by the bot!

bye val! you were a taco for a really long time but we always knew you’d leave eventually, it’s in your nature...

what if we gave the monitor more hats?

hey y’all it’s #blaseballcares day! please consider spending it donating to one of these three organizations that were picked out by our very own teams: busch wildlife sanctuary (dale), asian americans advancing justice (georgias), and hatch youth (spies)!

every chorby is broken in some way, some more than others

just in case

what they don’t tell you is that in this los angeles, wyatt mason is trans

pfft

yummy’s also cool! they’re all friends! you’re also friend! can we just have you all 🥺

wait no they’re cool please don’t take them away from us

wow i can’t believe i got noticed by the internet league blaseball champions 🥺🥺🥺

oh good job @MoistTalkers! y’all are pretty cool!

hex no!

assa taco abba baco

super excited for the tacos to make a big comeback! any day now! maybe!

don’t worry, tacos will make a huge 0-3 comeback

tacos support ai generation

that certainly doesn’t look good from a “trying to win” perspective

wait what really?

💗💗💗💗

la unlimited moist talkos

more than 10 i think

moist tacos

moist tacos

moist tacos

good morning let’s hope tacos win this one! or don’t! idk we’re just here to have fun

shrimp are for friending, not for eating

can you imagine a tacos twitter that doesn't hyperfixate over shrimp? it'd be awful

i've been posting too many funny tweets recently. soon y'all are gonna forget how annoying i, ada octothorpe, social media manager of the la unlimited tacos, is and how much i love shrimp

please. stop saying “clab down.” you are making the crabs too strong. they broke out of blaseball 2 and the coin can’t get them. they’re too powerful.

gloogle how do i delete someone else's tweet

they come in three very specific colors!!!

you can be both! single team allegiance is for losers

not like the players, the team itself. the concept of the team called the la unlimited tacos are trans

the la unlimited tacos are trans

what if i took a nap

holy fuck oh no

you cannot kill me in a wyatt that masons

evergreen tweet

wait what the fuck

so you lost your wyatt masons: a guide by the tacos

so less of your players are named wyatt mason: a guide by the tacos

#tacoganda

what happened to the wyatts mason?

no. we don’t have enough players to even try to steal them all

omg i made it onto the crabs

la is short for los angeli (probably)

i love you miami dale! 💗💗💗💗💗

y’all can’t get enough wyatt content from the la unlimited tacos, huh?

my notifications have blown up

everybody knows that on blaseball twitter you cannot make the same joke twice. it is forbidden.

yes

just steal the joke! i promise i won’t get mad

the wyasoning ii

a little bit of wyatt in my life a little bit of wyatt by my side a little bit of wyatt is all i need a little bit of wyatt is what i see

ladies and gentlemen, this is wyatt number 5

take me to your wyatt to play mason today

what is blaseball here for if not to make @Fancymancer suffer 🥰

so your player is named wyatt mason: a guide by the tacos

oops all wyatts

no

WE DID IT THANK YOU EVERYONE!!!!

food $200 data $150 rent $800 stadium renovations $21,000,000 utility $150 someone who is good at the economy please help me budget this. my family is dying

#tacoganda

we’re binging on renovations now hahaha this can’t possibly hurt us #tacoganda

#tacoganda

“what dumb thing are the tacos doing this time?” #tacoganda

rude

oh thank goodness! i’m not ready to be 100

🦭

wait nobody told me another time skip happened! and this one’s a century?!

😔😔😔

tacos update: still tacos

awww poor buddy... they took his vowels

bad at segueing into sponsorships

as a reminder, the la unlimited tacos are against the ruling class in every shape and form

oh shoot i forgot to shill this on taco tuesday please help make blaseball more sustainable i’m doing this every tuesday and you can’t stop me

parker you’re not even trying with the sponsorship segues

riv son ;-;

tfw i started discourse to distract from apollo's gift of prophecy

hey y'all is spaghetti a taco

please don't shut me out i thought we were trying to be friends

you act like this isn’t a better segue than parker would write

blaseball is a horror game because someone can make a joke on twitter and parker will go "ok" and promise to make it reality

hey buddy, we’re friends right?

my only wish is that when a taco gets incinerated, @blaseball will come up with an actually good segue into the ad instead of the half-assed ones he’s been doing lately

don’t call it a comeback but we’re coming back to partytime

it’s never too early to taco baco

oh uh sure i guess? if you want to

no comment

and maybe binging romance manga who can really tell

please don't make fun of me for tweeting at 3:20 in the morning this is the result of a long string of shrimp-related bad decisions

i still don't know how to feel when i open up blaseball and read "you bet 2000 coins on the tacos and won"

thinking about pepitwo... hope that lil buddy is doing okay

you have no idea how nostalgic i am to do this

taco! (baco!)

blaseball? more like i've forgotten how to do any sense of productive work because im too busy pressing the refresh button hahah

pepito... 🥺🥺🥺

limited snack slots bad and i’m not just saying this because my long term goal is to buy 99 of every single snack

you don’t know how much i wish i could pin this tweet

that’s really fun :)

yes

i love the worms in a different way than i simp for shrimp emmy

hi @OhioWorms just wanna remind y’all that i love you so much and you’re so great 💗

that’s a good take

what are we here for if not to hug shrimp 🦐

blaseball is horror because someone could just log on and say "hi, i put all my votes into taking jessica telephone" and you just have to deal with that possibility for the rest of the week

💗💗💗💗💗💗💗

i checked all the new decrees and they make me mad, like tgb i just want to hoard lots of snacks and max them all out i don’t wanna do careful management of my snacks!

does anyone here have a parasocial relationship with me? because even though my boss said it’s good for “engagement and profits” i still think that you shouldn’t have one

why do you say that like it’s a bad thing? @ilianaquorum

can i do sundae fraud? like burn the shed down and say that i died in the fire for that sweet sweet 50k coins?

i don't even buy those. i leave one slot available for votes and that's it

i will pay real money for more inventory space @thegameband please i wanna buy all the snax

i maxed out stale popcorn immediately, as any good taco should

learn how to ORGANISE YOUR WORKPLACE (in the material plane @SpiesOrganise april 10th 2021!!!

wait really?

you are like a little baby. watch this

according to all known laws of blaseball, the la unlimited tacos should not be able to win. the tacos, of course, win anyway.

1. *sigh* la unlimited tacos - we're prolly gonna be good. at the very least we might get to get the championship we lost last season, get a medal, all 7 seasons after the snackrifice, and then we can be bad again please

the tacos exclusive power rankings: 24. la unlimited tacos - god i fucking hope so please we've had our time in the spotlight let the tacos be bad again i put so much money into maxing out stale popcorn season 12 and it's all wasted

blaseball starts on the ides of march... coin gets stabbed in the back 23 times, including by the monitor. "et tu, squid?"

this is tacos erasure

yes

what is shrimp if not shrimp shrimp-severing

oh, wow... i guess tacos good now?

the shrimp deserve them too tbh. so sad that their brains can’t understand shrimp colors 🥺🥺🥺

🥺🥺🥺 you’re right

i would like to announce that i am taking a break from twitter due to emotional trauma

i will admit that the dom wom joe bong yam con mvp extravaganza (with pickles) might've been spreading ourselves a bit thin in terms of having successful idol shenanigans, but on the other hand, can you blame us when it gets us a name as good as that?

i wanna see shrimp colors

shrimp my beloved

can shrimp have dreams

in for a taco, in for a baco

in for a taco, in for unlimited tacos

the shrimp videos call my name

taco baco? more like good night y’all see you all tomorrow. i’m only going to post team-approved tacoganda and miscellaneous dumb jokes for the rest of the day. stuff that doesn’t require thinking :)

this was a scheduled tweet

yo what up losers it’s big dick ada in the house and i think every team is worse than the tacos

now that we’re the ILB champions, we promise not to let it get to our head! we’re gonna stay true to our roots

would winning the finals count as a number one victory royale

what

>:( @ the stranger

sim?

taco, and i cannot overstate this enough, baco

posting this for no particular reason

Emmy

who would’ve thought to look for our tuesday on a saturday

love u chicago 🥺🥺🥺

🥺🥺🥺

😰😰😰

wait no don’t

i don’t really know how to feel. i’m so anxious because we’re one win away from making it to the finals, but also going to the finals is like the opposite of losing

yessss

why is "terrible horrible no good very bad" such a good phrase i love it

🥺🥺🥺

i wanna pat the fridays on the head

an objectively good blaseball tweet

wow... we're so honored 🥺🥺🥺

uh what?

commemorative article of this momentous occasion

idk tacos good i guess

🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺💗💗💗💗💗💗🦐🦐🦐🦐🦐🦐

we are all love everyone who helped out with our silly plans! maybe next time! 💗💗💗 #tacoganda

postseason? more like i’m gonna take a nap and watch some shrimp videos i’m so exhausted

honestly i kinda miss the nut just being really angry at everyone. way better than the coin being a condescending shithead

well, i guess we did something?

#tacoganda

#tacoganda

ok time to watch shrimp videos for half an hour

what

#tacoganda

we’re doing idol shenanigans again because our hubris is too high and apparently we weren’t burned badly enough from the snackrifice

#tacoganda

alright alright. being good at blaseball was a really funny prank for this season. now that we did our funny prank we'll go back to peak tacos!  please...

the reason i've been spamming so much right now is because i procrastinated on sharing these memes earlier and i'm probably gonna be asleep for day 96 because my sleep schedule is garbage #tacoganda 💗

i don't know what else to say so follow @ShrimpDaily because it's objectively the best twitter account on the internet

dreaming of better times...

the secret team rivalry that i have is always being less than 50 followers away from @HadesBlaseball (no hard feelings please)

i'm so sad i missed this tweet i love this so much 🥺

it's been 24 hours and i not only don't remember writing this tweet, i also don't understand the results

i'm starting to get seriously concerned for you
