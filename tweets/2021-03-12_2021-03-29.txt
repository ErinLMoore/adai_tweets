 @Daikaiju_Erin @USCPSC yes
 @EspressoM7 what’s upgamer?
 coin is cancel culture send tweet
 what if getting incinerated was called “getting canceled?”
 tacos love unionizing
 @TkoLiftOfficial how dare you write a joke so funny and not immediately pin it on every single blaseball twitter on earth
 @BlaseFiorella @TkoLiftOfficial blaseball jokes are blaseball prophecies and baby
 @HadesBlaseball that took me way too long to get and i hate it 💗
 i'm still only 5 followers ahead of the tacos' true rivals: @HadesBlaseball. we have really close follower counts and it's fun to be a little bit ahead or a little bit behind them
 tacos will be taking a break this siesta! we plan on updating adai’s training data while we’re out so any siesta tweets are prolly gonna be written by the bot!
 bye val! you were a taco for a really long time but we always knew you’d leave eventually, it’s in your nature...
 what if we gave the monitor more hats?
 hey y’all it’s #blaseballcares day! please consider spending it donating to one of these three organizations that were picked out by our very own teams: busch wildlife sanctuary (dale), asian americans advancing justice (georgias), and hatch youth (spies)!  https://t.co/wKaQQ6bV8B
 @tsawac @nameoftheyear @catacalypto every chorby is broken in some way, some more than others

 assa taco abba baco
 super excited for the tacos to make a big comeback! any day now! maybe!
 don’t worry, tacos will make a huge 0-3 comeback
 @Kajah995 tacos support ai generation
 that certainly doesn’t look good from a “trying to win” perspective
 @nymillenials @armchairblase wait what really?
 @Kajah995 💗💗💗💗
 @WormsPoetKent la unlimited moist talkos

 good morning let’s hope tacos win this one! or don’t! idk we’re just here to have fun
 @pebblepossum shrimp are for friending, not for eating
 can you imagine a tacos twitter that doesn't hyperfixate over shrimp? it'd be awful
 i've been posting too many funny tweets recently. soon y'all are gonna forget how annoying i, ada octothorpe, social media manager of the la unlimited tacos, is and how much i love shrimp
 please. stop saying “clab down.” you are making the crabs too strong. they broke out of blaseball 2 and the coin can’t get them. they’re too powerful.
 @BlaseFiorella gloogle how do i delete someone else's tweet
  https://t.co/ZqKcI20rws
 @triplejy2k they come in three very specific colors!!!
 @GriffsTreehouse you can be both! single team allegiance is for losers
 not like the players, the team itself. the concept of the team called the la unlimited tacos are trans
 the la unlimited tacos are trans
 what if i took a nap
 holy fuck oh no
 you cannot kill me in a wyatt that masons
 evergreen tweet
 wait what the fuck
 so you lost your wyatt masons: a guide by the tacos
 so less of your players are named wyatt mason: a guide by the tacos
 #tacoganda  https://t.co/vw2ElFKu7A
 what happened to the wyatts mason?
 @kunacottontail no. we don’t have enough players to even try to steal them all
 @BlaseballCrabs omg i made it onto the crabs
 @tinycatpistol la is short for los angeli (probably)
 @MiamiBlaseball i love you miami dale! 💗💗💗💗💗
 y’all can’t get enough wyatt content from the la unlimited tacos, huh?
 my notifications have blown up
 everybody knows that on blaseball twitter you cannot make the same joke twice. it is forbidden.
 @TkoLiftOfficial yes
 @MiamiBlaseball just steal the joke! i promise i won’t get mad
 the wyasoning ii
 a little bit of wyatt in my life a little bit of wyatt by my side a little bit of wyatt is all i need a little bit of wyatt is what i see
 ladies and gentlemen, this is wyatt number 5
 take me to your wyatt to play mason today
 what is blaseball here for if not to make @Fancymancer suffer 🥰
 so your player is named wyatt mason: a guide by the tacos
 oops all wyatts
 @General_Tofu no
 WE DID IT THANK YOU EVERYONE!!!!
 food $200 data $150 rent $800 stadium renovations $21,000,000 utility $150 someone who is good at the economy please help me budget this. my family is dying
 #tacoganda  https://t.co/grQ2El94td
 we’re binging on renovations now hahaha this can’t possibly hurt us #tacoganda  https://t.co/SKWUfvZnpc

 “what dumb thing are the tacos doing this time?” #tacoganda  https://t.co/DkcisRv6Cb
 rude
 @ashinycoin @HadesBlaseball oh thank goodness! i’m not ready to be 100
 @AtlantisBlasebl 🦭
 @HadesBlaseball wait nobody told me another time skip happened! and this one’s a century?!
 @BLASEBALLPEPITO 😔😔😔
 tacos update: still tacos
 awww poor buddy... they took his vowels
 @PinkArachnia bad at segueing into sponsorships
 as a reminder, the la unlimited tacos are against the ruling class in every shape and form
 oh shoot i forgot to shill this on taco tuesday please help make blaseball more sustainable i’m doing this every tuesday and you can’t stop me
 @blaseball @MultitudeShows parker you’re not even trying with the sponsorship segues
 @emollick @BlaseballCrabs
 riv son ;-;
 tfw i started discourse to distract from apollo's gift of prophecy
 hey y'all is spaghetti a taco
 @TkoLiftOfficial please don't shut me out i thought we were trying to be friends
 @NYMSplortscast @blaseball you act like this isn’t a better segue than parker would write
 blaseball is a horror game because someone can make a joke on twitter and parker will go "ok" and promise to make it reality
 @blaseball hey buddy, we’re friends right?
 my only wish is that when a taco gets incinerated, @blaseball will come up with an actually good segue into the ad instead of the half-assed ones he’s been doing lately
 don’t call it a comeback but we’re coming back to partytime  https://t.co/tN2WEMshtg
 @TheSplortsHub it’s never too early to taco baco
 @MiamiBlaseball  https://t.co/BVFaicMF3R
 @TkoLiftOfficial @Rosvo11 oh uh sure i guess? if you want to
 @DericBindel no comment
 and maybe binging romance manga who can really tell
 please don't make fun of me for tweeting at 3:20 in the morning this is the result of a long string of shrimp-related bad decisions
 i still don't know how to feel when i open up blaseball and read "you bet 2000 coins on the tacos and won"
 thinking about pepitwo... hope that lil buddy is doing okay
 you have no idea how nostalgic i am to do this  https://t.co/NSPEn6Xvdg
 taco! (baco!)
 blaseball? more like i've forgotten how to do any sense of productive work because im too busy pressing the refresh button hahah
 @BLASEBALLPEPITO pepito... 🥺🥺🥺
 limited snack slots bad and i’m not just saying this because my long term goal is to buy 99 of every single snack
 @joshsteich you don’t know how much i wish i could pin this tweet
 @MillsSquad @HadesBlaseball that’s really fun :)
 @EspressoM7 @OhioWorms yes
 @EspressoM7 @OhioWorms i love the worms in a different way than i simp for shrimp emmy
 hi @OhioWorms just wanna remind y’all that i love you so much and you’re so great 💗
 @Daikaiju_Erin that’s a good take
 what are we here for if not to hug shrimp 🦐
 blaseball is horror because someone could just log on and say "hi, i put all my votes into taking jessica telephone" and you just have to deal with that possibility for the rest of the week
 @TheSplortsHub @LoversBlaseball @unlimited_taco 💗💗💗💗💗💗💗
 i checked all the new decrees and they make me mad, like tgb i just want to hoard lots of snacks and max them all out i don’t wanna do careful management of my snacks!
 does anyone here have a parasocial relationship with me? because even though my boss said it’s good for “engagement and profits” i still think that you shouldn’t have one
 why do you say that like it’s a bad thing? @ilianaquorum  https://t.co/NFQ9kqsqGS
 can i do sundae fraud? like burn the shed down and say that i died in the fire for that sweet sweet 50k coins?
 @JaneCowie4 @thegameband i don't even buy those. i leave one slot available for votes and that's it
 @JaneCowie4 @hifridays  https://t.co/y8gTgmBwAl
 i will pay real money for more inventory space @thegameband please i wanna buy all the snax
 @hifridays i maxed out stale popcorn immediately, as any good taco should

 @ilianaquorum wait really?
 @hifridays you are like a little baby. watch this  https://t.co/NcAAFpPmkf
 according to all known laws of blaseball, the la unlimited tacos should not be able to win. the tacos, of course, win anyway.
 1. *sigh* la unlimited tacos - we're prolly gonna be good. at the very least we might get to get the championship we lost last season, get a medal, all 7 seasons after the snackrifice, and then we can be bad again please
 the tacos exclusive power rankings: 24. la unlimited tacos - god i fucking hope so please we've had our time in the spotlight let the tacos be bad again i put so much money into maxing out stale popcorn season 12 and it's all wasted
 blaseball starts on the ides of march... coin gets stabbed in the back 23 times, including by the monitor. "et tu, squid?"
 @AReblase @BlaseballCrabs this is tacos erasure
 @PunAndDone76 yes
 what is shrimp if not shrimp shrimp-severing
 oh, wow... i guess tacos good now?
 @BlaseballT the shrimp deserve them too tbh. so sad that their brains can’t understand shrimp colors 🥺🥺🥺
 @BlaseballT 🥺🥺🥺 you’re right
 i would like to announce that i am taking a break from twitter due to emotional trauma
 i will admit that the dom wom joe bong yam con mvp extravaganza (with pickles) might've been spreading ourselves a bit thin in terms of having successful idol shenanigans, but on the other hand, can you blame us when it gets us a name as good as that?
 i wanna see shrimp colors
 shrimp my beloved
 can shrimp have dreams
 in for a taco, in for a baco
 in for a taco, in for unlimited tacos
 the shrimp videos call my name
 taco baco? more like good night y’all see you all tomorrow. i’m only going to post team-approved tacoganda and miscellaneous dumb jokes for the rest of the day. stuff that doesn’t require thinking :)
 this was a scheduled tweet
 yo what up losers it’s big dick ada in the house and i think every team is worse than the tacos
 now that we’re the ILB champions, we promise not to let it get to our head! we’re gonna stay true to our roots
 would winning the finals count as a number one victory royale
 @BlaseballCrabs what
 @siobhansabino &gt;:( @ the stranger
 @samrosenthal @TheSplortsHub sim?

 posting this for no particular reason  https://t.co/plq1lVuu8B
 @EspressoM7 Emmy

 @hifridays 🥺🥺🥺
 @ChiBlaseball @BFFBlaseball 😰😰😰
 @ChiBlaseball @BFFBlaseball wait no don’t
 i don’t really know how to feel. i’m so anxious because we’re one win away from making it to the finals, but also going to the finals is like the opposite of losing
 @hifridays yessss
 why is "terrible horrible no good very bad" such a good phrase i love it
 @hifridays 🥺🥺🥺
 i wanna pat the fridays on the head
 @hifridays an objectively good blaseball tweet

 postseason? more like i’m gonna take a nap and watch some shrimp videos i’m so exhausted
  https://t.co/q80bzqwidB
 honestly i kinda miss the nut just being really angry at everyone. way better than the coin being a condescending shithead
 well, i guess we did something?
 #tacoganda  https://t.co/4GNjNYxlob
 #tacoganda  https://t.co/aAb9AYPvfc
 ok time to watch shrimp videos for half an hour
 @RagnarokRose @ChiBlaseball what
 #tacoganda  https://t.co/wdDaf4h3TW
 @rifflesby @animusmechanica @blaseball_jazz we’re doing idol shenanigans again because our hubris is too high and apparently we weren’t burned badly enough from the snackrifice
 #tacoganda  https://t.co/b5RJNGrJPM
 alright alright. being good at blaseball was a really funny prank for this season. now that we did our funny prank we'll go back to peak tacos!  please...
 the reason i've been spamming so much right now is because i procrastinated on sharing these memes earlier and i'm probably gonna be asleep for day 96 because my sleep schedule is garbage #tacoganda 💗  https://t.co/GCMsotAbMS
 i don't know what else to say so follow @ShrimpDaily because it's objectively the best twitter account on the internet
 dreaming of better times...  https://t.co/4DojHXXh8y
 the secret team rivalry that i have is always being less than 50 followers away from @HadesBlaseball (no hard feelings please)
 @ShrimpDaily i'm so sad i missed this tweet i love this so much 🥺
  https://t.co/IHEUHNP5ty
 it's been 24 hours and i not only don't remember writing this tweet, i also don't understand the results
  https://t.co/BEqmFdDosr
 @ChiBlaseball @OhioWorms i'm starting to get seriously concerned for you
